    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Bollywood Star in Rs 100 Crore Ponzi Scheme</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Bollywood actor Shreyas Talpade has been accused in a Rs 100 crore ponzi scam in Uttar Pradesh's Mahoba district.  He and 14 others allegedly defrauded villagers through 'The Loni Urban Multistate Credit and Thrift Cooperative Society Limited', promising high returns on their investments. The company collected crores before disappearing, leaving investors with substantial losses. This incident adds to Talpade's legal troubles, as he is also implicated in a separate Rs 9 crore fraud case in Uttar Pradesh and a multi-level marketing scam in Haryana. The Loni Urban Cooperative Society is under investigation for similar fraudulent activities in Uttarakhand, where it reportedly operated 35 unauthorized branches and defrauded investors of Rs 92 crore.">
