    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - South India's Vote Shrinks Despite Economic Boom</title>
    <meta name="description" content="India's upcoming delimitation process, based on the 2011-36 population projections, is projected to significantly reduce the South's political representation in the Lok Sabha. While the South's population is projected to increase by 2.9 crores, Uttar Pradesh alone is expected to add 5.8 crores. This could decrease the South's Lok Sabha representation from 25% to 19%.

This demographic shift comes at a time when the South already contributes disproportionately to India's GDP, generating 30% of the national GDP with 20% of the population.  

Political scientists suggest a balance of power by tweaking the Rajya Sabha. One proposed approach is dividing Uttar Pradesh into regions based on economic development, allowing for tailored policies and potentially mitigating the South's political decline.">
