    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Bamboo Straws: Sip Sustainably,  Future is Biodegradable</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Researchers at IIT-BHU Varanasi have developed eco-friendly drinking straws from bamboo and waste biomass. These straws are biodegradable, strong, reusable, and resist fizzing.  

The team, led by Assistant Professor Prodyut Dhar, received an Indian Patent for their invention (No. 557472). The technology has been transferred for potential industrial production and discussions are underway for mass manufacturing.

Besides bamboo, the lab is exploring other biomass sources like rice straws, wheat straws, and papaya waste, some with added properties like spoilage sensing and adulteration detection. A recent study published in the Chemical Engineering Journal showcases a gelatin-based composite derived from bamboo waste that further enhances straw durability and biodegradability.">
