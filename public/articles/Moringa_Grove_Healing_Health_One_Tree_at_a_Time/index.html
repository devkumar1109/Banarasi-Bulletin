    <meta name="description" content="The Varanasi health department is planting moringa trees at government hospitals and health centers to improve the environment and provide nutritional benefits. 

Moringa is a nutrient-rich tree with leaves, pods, and seeds packed with vitamins, antioxidants, and amino acids, beneficial for health.  

The initiative aims to address malnutrition, as 32% of children in India are underweight. 

Two moringa trees will be planted at each Community Health Center (CHC), Primary Health Center (PHC), and health sub-center in the district. 

The planting drive also emphasizes reducing plastic pollution, as plastic harms the environment and aquatic life.">
