    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT-BHU Turns Plastic Waste into Fuel</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Researchers at IIT-BHU have developed a technology to convert plastic waste into fuel oil. This eco-friendly process uses a multiphase catalytic pyrolysis reactor with natural catalysts derived from river clay. 

The technology can process plastics like polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene, turning them into diesel and kerosene-range fuels. 

This innovation addresses Varanasi's plastic waste problem, which causes waterlogging, harm to animals, and environmental contamination. 

The technology is patented in India and recognized internationally. The team is now working on scaling it for commercial production.">
