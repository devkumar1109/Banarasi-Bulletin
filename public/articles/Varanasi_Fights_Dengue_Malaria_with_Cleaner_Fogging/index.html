    <meta name="description" content="The Varanasi health department is implementing cold fogging to prevent dengue and malaria. This trial began in Prime Minister's Model Village Kurhua, using a water-based insecticide instead of diesel-based fogging. 

Cold fogging produces mist and is less polluting. It will be used in 45 houses around dengue patients and in sensitive village panchayats.  

The technique may also be used in hospitals and hot spots during the infection period.">
