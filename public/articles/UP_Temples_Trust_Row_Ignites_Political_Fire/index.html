    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Temples: Trust Row Ignites Political Fire</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh government has formed a trust to manage the Banke Bihari temple in Mathura, part of a plan to redevelop the Banke Bihari corridor. This move has sparked criticism from Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, who accuses the BJP government of attempting to "indirectly control" temples under the guise of better administration.  

The Department of Religious Affairs, responsible for temples and religious institutions in UP, was revived by Akhilesh during his tenure as CM. It gained further prominence under the Yogi Adityanath government, which established several "parishads" to develop religious sites, including the Braj Teerth Vikas Parishad for Mathura and Vrindavan. The Adityanath government has also increased financial assistance for pilgrims undertaking religious pilgrimages.">
