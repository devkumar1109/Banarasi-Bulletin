    <meta name="description" content="The theatrical release of Rajkummar Rao and Wamiqa Gabbi starrer "Bhool Chuk Maaf" has been cancelled due to heightened security following the Pahalgam attack and India's retaliatory operation, "Operation Sindoor."

At least 28 Hindu men were killed by terrorists in Pahalgam on April 22, 2025, prompting India to conduct precision strikes at nine terrorist bases across Pakistan and PoK.  

As a result of the security situation, Maddock Films, the production house behind "Bhool Chuk Maaf," decided to pull the film from theatres and release it directly on OTT next week.">
