    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Piyush Chawla Spins Final Over, Retires</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Former Indian cricketer Piyush Chawla has retired from all formats of the game. Chawla announced his retirement on Instagram, expressing gratitude for the support throughout his career.  

Known for his early impact, Chawla represented India Under-19 and Uttar Pradesh U-22 at 15. He played a crucial role in Uttar Pradesh's first Ranji Trophy win by taking 35 wickets and scoring 224 runs in his debut first-class season. 

Chawla's impressive performances in the 2007 tour of Ireland and England, where he took 14 wickets, and his ODI debut in Bangladesh, where he bagged three wickets, showcased his talent.  Despite a strong performance in the inaugural IPL, Chawla struggled to secure a consistent spot in the Indian Test squad after Anil Kumble's retirement.">
