    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - AI Robot Teacher Bridges Gap in Remote Village</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In a remote Uttarakhand village near the Nepal border, Jajar Chingri's government primary school has introduced Eco, an AI-powered robotic teacher. Headmaster Chandra Sekhar Joshi, with help from a friend in China, purchased the Rs 4 lakh robot to bridge technological gaps and provide students with a modern education. Eco, which can operate in both Hindi and English, teaches math and enhances digital literacy. The school, lacking a dedicated math teacher for three years, relies on Eco to fill this gap. Students are excited to interact with Eco, asking questions about various subjects and benefiting from its ability to answer, correct mistakes, and motivate them.">
