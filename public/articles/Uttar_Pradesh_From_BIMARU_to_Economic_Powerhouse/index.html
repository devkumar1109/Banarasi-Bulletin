    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Uttar Pradesh: From BIMARU to Economic Powerhouse</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath claims the state has transformed from a lagging region to India's economic powerhouse in the past eight years. He attributes this success to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's policies. 

Before 2017, Uttar Pradesh was categorized as a "BIMARU" state, but now leads in multiple sectors. Adityanath highlights the agricultural sector's turnaround, with growth increasing from 5% in 2016-17 to over 13.5% currently.  Food grain production has also surged from 557 lakh metric tonnes in 2016-17 to over 668 lakh metric tonnes last year, a nearly 20% increase.  He credits this to the government's decision to waive farmers' loans worth Rs 36,000 crore.">
