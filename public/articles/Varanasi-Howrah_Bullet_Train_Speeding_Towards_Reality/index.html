    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi-Howrah Bullet Train: Speeding Towards Reality</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Varanasi-Howrah Bullet Train is a proposed 760 km high-speed rail corridor connecting Varanasi and Howrah, passing through cities like Buxar, Arrah, Patna, Gaya, Dhanbad, Asansol, Durgapur, and Burdwan.  

Designed for speeds up to 350 km/h, the train aims to reduce travel time between the cities to just over two hours.  

The project is currently in the Detailed Project Report (DPR) stage, with surveys underway to finalize the route and assess land requirements. In Bihar, the route will be completely elevated with stations in Buxar, Patna, and Gaya.  


Land acquisition has begun, and officials are awaiting railway approval to start construction.">
