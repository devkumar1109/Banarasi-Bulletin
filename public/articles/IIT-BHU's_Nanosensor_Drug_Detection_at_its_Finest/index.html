    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT-BHU's Nanosensor: Drug Detection at its Finest</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A team of researchers at IIT BHU has developed a 3D trimetallic nanodendrite-based electrochemical sensing device for highly sensitive and precise drug detection.  This device can detect even trace amounts of drugs in pharmaceutical formulations and milk samples. 

IIT-BHU holds the patent for this technology, with Prof Pranjal Chandra, Rohini Kumari, and Daphika S Dkhar as the inventors. The device is notable for its stability, fast response time, and single-step modification process. It aims to address the challenges of antibiotic overuse and resistance by providing a practical and efficient platform for drug analysis. The technology was validated in real sample matrices, including milk samples and drug formulations.">
