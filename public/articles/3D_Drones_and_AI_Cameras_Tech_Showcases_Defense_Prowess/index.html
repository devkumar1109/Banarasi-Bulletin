    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - 3D Drones and AI Cameras: Tech Showcases Defense Prowess</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The 39 Gorkha Training Centre in Varanasi showcased lightweight, 3D-printed surveillance drones at the Surya Drona Tech-2025 event in Dehradun. These drones, designed and manufactured in-house, have a 10 km range, 20-30 minute battery life, and VR capabilities, enabling live feeds for ground troops.  The use of 3D printing allows for quick replacement of broken parts.  The center is also developing a wired drone to counter drone jamming technology.  

Another highlight was Optomized Electrotech from Gujarat, showcasing an AI-enabled surveillance camera device called Noctvision. This device can identify individuals in crowds of up to 500,000 people by analyzing facial bone dimensions and is already in use by the Gujarat police.">
