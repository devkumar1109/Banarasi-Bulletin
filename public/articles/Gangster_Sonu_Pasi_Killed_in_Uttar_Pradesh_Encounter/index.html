    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Gangster Sonu Pasi Killed in Uttar Pradesh Encounter</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Sonu Pasi alias Bhure, a notorious gangster with a Rs 1 lakh bounty, was killed in an encounter with police in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh.  Wanted in 53 cases including murder, dacoity, and robbery, Pasi was intercepted near Sonouli Mohammadpur Bandha. He opened fire on the police, leading to a retaliatory fire that resulted in his death.  Police recovered a .32 bore illegal pistol, a country-made .315 bore gun, and cartridges from the slain criminal.  A police officer was unharmed after a bullet from Pasi's gun hit his bulletproof jacket.  This encounter follows a theft last month where Pasi allegedly shot a villager who resisted, prompting a massive manhunt.">
