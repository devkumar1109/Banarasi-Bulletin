    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - SP X Handle in FIR for Offensive Post Against Pathak</title>
    <meta name="description" content="An FIR was filed in Lucknow against the unknown handler of the Samajwadi Party's official X handle for a post targeting Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Brajesh Pathak. BJP's Lucknow Metropolitan President Anand Dwivedi filed the complaint, alleging the post contained objectionable content against Pathak's deceased mother and aimed to incite social unrest.  

Police booked the case under sections related to intentional insult, public mischief, and defamation, along with relevant IT Act sections. Pathak condemned the language used, while Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya criticized the Samajwadi Party's character. The SP's media cell responded by sharing news clippings of Pathak referring to the "DNA of Samajwadi Party." BJP workers staged protests in Hazratganj following the incident.">
