    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - ED Attaches Assets in UP's NRHM Scam</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached assets worth Rs. 89.84 lakh in Uttar Pradesh's NRHM scam.  The scam involved misuse of funds allocated for rural healthcare services, leading to a CBI investigation and arrests. The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in 2005 to improve healthcare in rural areas but was marred by corruption and irregularities in Uttar Pradesh. 

The scam came to light after the murders of two Chief Medical Officers (CMOs) in 2010 and 2011.  The CBI has alleged large-scale irregularities, including the embezzlement of crores of rupees meant for the distribution to CMOs.  The alleged corruption resulted in a public outcry and scrutiny of the Mayawati government at the time.">
