    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Priest's Power: Bageshwar Dham Shapes Politics</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Dhirendra Krishna Shastri, the chief priest of Bageshwar Dham, has gained significant political influence.  PM Modi visited Bageshwar Dham to lay the foundation stone for a medical institute, referring to Shastri as his "younger brother." 

Shastri's religious complex attracts lakhs of devotees who believe in his supernatural abilities.  Initially focused on devotion and problem-solving, Shastri has adopted a hardline Hindutva stance, advocating for a Hindu nation and condemning conversions.  

Leaders from both the BJP and Congress are vying for Shastri's support, recognizing his influence in regions like Bundelkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Jharkhand. The BJP appears to be benefiting more from this outreach as the Congress struggles.">
