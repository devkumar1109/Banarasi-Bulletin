Using the Japanese Miyawaki technique, three new forest areas are being created, and 5.617 hectares of forest have already been developed in nine locations. 

Over 1.7 million trees have been planted since 2020-21, transforming nine areas into dense forests. Three new locations, including Ramna STP Plant and Banas Dairy Amul, are now undergoing tree planting.  

The Miyawaki method involves planting a variety of species, from grass to large trees, to create a diverse and resilient ecosystem.  


These initiatives aim to reduce pollution, provide clean air, and enhance the city's green spaces.">
