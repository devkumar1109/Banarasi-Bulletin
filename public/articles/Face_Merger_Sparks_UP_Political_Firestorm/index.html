    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Face Merger Sparks UP Political Firestorm</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A poster featuring merged faces of Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and BR Ambedkar sparked controversy in Uttar Pradesh. The poster, displayed outside the SP office in Lucknow, drew criticism from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), who accused the SP of disrespecting Ambedkar.  The BJP staged protests demanding an apology from Yadav.  SP distanced itself from the poster, claiming it was not official and possibly the work of BJP supporters.  The incident highlights the SP's efforts to woo Dalit voters, traditionally aligned with the BSP, and compete with the BJP for OBC support.  The SP's recent success in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, including a Dalit leader's victory in Ayodhya, has emboldened its strategy.  Mayawati warned the SP and Congress against further "insulting" Ambedkar or the BSP.">
