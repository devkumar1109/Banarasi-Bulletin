    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT-BHU Nanotech:  48 Hours of Blood Clotting Protection</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Researchers at IIT-BHU have developed Potassium Ferric Oxalate Nanoparticle (KFeOx-NPs) to prevent blood clotting and thrombosis. 

This new material is effective in preventing clotting for up to 48 hours without affecting blood cell structure. It addresses the limitations of existing anticoagulants like warfarin and heparin, which often cause side effects. 

KFeOx-NPs have been successfully tested on human blood samples and in a mouse model, demonstrating its potential for clinical application. The findings have been published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, and a patent has been filed for the nanomaterial.">
