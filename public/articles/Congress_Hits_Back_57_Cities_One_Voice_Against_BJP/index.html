    <meta name="description" content="Congress leaders will hold press conferences in 57 cities from April 21 to 24 to counter the BJP's claims in the National Herald case. The party describes the case as politically motivated and asserts that no crime was committed. 

Congress leaders, including Pawan Khera, P Chidambaram, Shashi Tharoor, and Ashok Gehlot, will address reporters in various cities across India. The party aims to expose what it calls "BJP's lies" and "anti-national efforts" to discredit The National Herald, which they view as a symbol of the freedom struggle. 

Congress has called the Enforcement Directorate's chargesheet a "lie-sheet" and expressed confidence in winning the legal battle against the government. They also allege that the BJP is targeting the Supreme Court.">
