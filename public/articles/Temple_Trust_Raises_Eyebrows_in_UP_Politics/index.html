    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Temple Trust Raises Eyebrows in UP Politics</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh Department of Religious Affairs has come under scrutiny following the BJP government's establishment of a trust to manage the Banke Bihari temple in Mathura. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav accused the government of "indirectly taking control" of temples under the guise of better administration. 

The department, revived by Akhilesh Yadav during his tenure as CM, is responsible for developing religious institutions and temples in the state. It gained further prominence under the Adityanath government, which established several "parishads" to develop pilgrimage sites. 

The government has increased assistance for pilgrims undertaking the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra and Sindhu Darshan Yatra. The move to establish a trust for the Banke Bihari temple follows the success of the Kashi Vishwanath corridor project in Varanasi.">
