    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Sticky Pesticides: MIT Tackles Runoff and Costs</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Researchers at MIT and their spinoff company have developed a technology to improve pesticide application efficiency. The technology applies a thin coating to pesticide droplets, allowing them to stick to plant leaves instead of bouncing off. 

This innovation addresses the issue of over-spraying, which results in pesticide runoff polluting waterways and accumulating in soil. It also reduces farmers' costs, as less pesticide is needed. 

The research, published in Soft Matter, highlights the importance of optimizing spraying techniques for sustainable and economical food production.">
