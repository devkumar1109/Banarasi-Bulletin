    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BJP Seeks OBC Strongman for UP</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The BJP is delaying the appointment of its next Uttar Pradesh state president as it searches for an Other Backward Class (OBC) leader from eastern UP.  The party feels pressure to pick an OBC or Dalit leader in response to the Samajwadi Party's focus on marginalized communities. 

The BJP hopes an eastern UP leader will help them regain lost ground in the region after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections where the SP won a majority of seats there.  The party is also considering Dalit faces but lacks a prominent figure.  

With 70 out of 98 district and city unit chiefs appointed, the party is close to finalizing the state president position.">
