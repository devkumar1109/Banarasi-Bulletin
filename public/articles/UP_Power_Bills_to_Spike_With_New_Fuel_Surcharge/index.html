    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Power Bills to Spike With New Fuel Surcharge</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Electricity bills in Uttar Pradesh will increase from April 2025 due to a newly implemented 1.24% "fuel surcharge" by the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL). This surcharge, absent for five years, is tied to fluctuating fuel costs and will be recalibrated monthly. 

The surcharge, first under the Multi Year Tariff Regulation 2025,  means bills will rise or fall based on power consumption and market fuel prices. A consumer paying Rs 1,000 in March will now pay Rs 1,012.40 for the same usage in April. 

The Uttar Pradesh State Electricity Consumer Council has criticized the surcharge, calling it unjustified and demanding its withdrawal.  UPPCL still owes Rs 33,122 crore to consumers.">
