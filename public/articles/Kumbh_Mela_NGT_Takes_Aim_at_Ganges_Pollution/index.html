    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Kumbh Mela: NGT Takes Aim at Ganges Pollution</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government and related authorities regarding concerns about sanitation at the Kumbh Mela. The NGT is responding to an application alleging that poor sanitation has resulted in open defecation along the Ganges River, contaminating the water. Water quality tests reveal high levels of faecal coliform bacteria, exceeding the Environment Ministry's benchmark for bathing water safety. The CPCB has reported that the Ganga's water quality does not meet bathing standards due to high faecal coliform levels, particularly impacting areas frequented by pilgrims during the Mahakumbh Mela.  The NGT has scheduled a hearing to address these concerns.">
