    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BJP Blasts Opposition Over Kumbh Tragedy</title>
    <meta name="description" content="BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi accused the opposition of seeking political gain from the Maha Kumbh tragedy, criticizing Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav for questioning the death toll. Trivedi highlighted Yadav's past skepticism regarding COVID-19 vaccines, the Ram Lalla consecration, and now the Kumbh tragedy, calling it a "habit" of seeking political mileage. 

He also condemned remarks like "Mrityu Kumbh" by opposition parties, alleging they promote anti-Hindu agendas.  Trivedi praised the successful organization of Maha Kumbh, attributing its success to Prime Minister Modi's policies, which have boosted tourism in Uttar Pradesh. He further criticized the opposition's stance on the deportation of Indian immigrants by the US, accusing them of opposing India's efforts to combat illegal immigration and viewing illegal Bangladeshi immigrants as a vote bank.">
