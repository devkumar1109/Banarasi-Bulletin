    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT Varanasi Wins Forensic Hackathon with Age-Telling Glycans</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A research team from IIT (BHU) Varanasi won the Forensic Hackathon 2025 for developing a glycan-based forensic technology to accurately estimate age using biological fluids.  Led by Prof. Sumit Kumar Singh, the team's innovation uses glycomic profiling and machine learning to decode molecular signatures, offering insights into an individual's age and health status. This technology addresses limitations of DNA-based methods, which can be inaccurate with degraded samples or diverse populations. 

The glycan-based approach can estimate both chronological and biological age, providing valuable information for criminal investigations.  This breakthrough was recognized with a cash prize of Rs two lakh and a memento, presented by Union Home Minister Amit Shah.">
