    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - India's Death Records: Gaps Hinder Post-Pandemic Planning</title>
    <meta name="description" content="India registered 10.2 million deaths in 2021, a 33% increase from 2019. While death registrations improved, only 23% of deaths were medically certified, a slight increase from 21% in 2019. This lack of medical certification hinders accurate cause-of-death data, crucial for post-pandemic healthcare planning, medical research, and improved diagnosis.  

Birth registrations increased by 4.6% from 2015 to 2021 but declined slightly compared to 2019.  Experts attribute this to concerns about inaccurate birth certificates leading to detention in Assam.  

Geographic and gender disparities exist in medical certification of deaths, highlighting the need for further improvement in data collection and accuracy.">
