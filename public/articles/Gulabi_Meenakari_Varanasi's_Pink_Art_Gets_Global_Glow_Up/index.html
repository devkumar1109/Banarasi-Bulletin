    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Gulabi Meenakari: Varanasi's Pink Art Gets Global Glow Up</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Varanasi's GI-tagged Gulabi Meenakari (pink enameling) is experiencing a resurgence in both domestic and international markets.  Backed by Prime Minister Modi and Chief Minister Adityanath, the craft, designated as an ODOP (One District One Product) in 2018, generates an annual business exceeding Rs. 12 crores.  

The revival of Gulabi Meenakari, which was struggling with declining demand and counterfeits, has provided employment to hundreds, particularly women.  Government support through training, loans, grants, and marketing efforts has attracted young artisans back to the craft.  

Orders are now coming from both domestic and international markets, with women's jewelry, wedding gifts, and corporate gifting seeing increased demand. PM Modi and CM Adityanath have promoted Gulabi Meenakari as a brand ambassador for GI and ODOP products, expanding its global reach.">
