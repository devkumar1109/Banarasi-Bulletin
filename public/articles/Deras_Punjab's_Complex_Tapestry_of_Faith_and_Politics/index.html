    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Deras: Punjab's Complex Tapestry of Faith and Politics</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Santosh K Singh's book "The Deras: Culture, Diversity and Politics" examines the role of Deras in Punjab's social and political life. Singh began his research serendipitously, observing laborers wearing symbols of Dera affiliation. He found Deras to be complex, multifaceted spaces, distinct from other religious institutions in India due to their South Asian tradition of philosophical dissent and breakaways from dominant religions. 

While some Deras receive negative attention, Singh emphasizes that they cannot be simply categorized as Dalit institutions, though many attract large Dalit followings. Deras offer solace, a sense of community, and a space for equality, particularly for Dalits who feel alienated by caste-based inequalities within Sikhism.">
