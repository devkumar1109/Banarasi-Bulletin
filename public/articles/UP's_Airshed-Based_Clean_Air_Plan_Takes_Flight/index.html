    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP's Airshed-Based Clean Air Plan Takes Flight</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh launched the Uttar Pradesh Clean Air Plan (UCAP), India's first state-level clean air strategy grounded in scientific analysis and an airshed-based approach.  The plan, released by principal secretary Anil Kumar, targets key pollution sources like household emissions, transport, industries, and agriculture.  

UCAP introduces an airshed management approach, recognizing air pollution's travel between urban and rural areas. Funding for its implementation comes from the USD 320 million Uttar Pradesh Clean Air Management Project (UPCAMP), financed by the World Bank.  UPCAMP focuses on strengthening airshed institutional mechanisms, expanding air quality monitoring networks, and piloting innovative clean air measures.">
