    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh is accelerating the digitization of old revenue records under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The Stamp and Registration Department is prioritizing the digitization of records from before 1990, following the near completion of digitizing deeds from 2002-2017.  An agency will soon be selected to handle this task.  

The digitization process, being carried out in phases, aims to ease access to information, save resources, and modernize administrative procedures. Once digitized, the hard copies will be stored in a central record room, freeing up space in sub-registrar offices.  This initiative is part of a larger digital governance push by the CM.">
