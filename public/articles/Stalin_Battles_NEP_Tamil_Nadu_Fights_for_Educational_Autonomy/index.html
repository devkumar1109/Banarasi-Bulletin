    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Stalin Battles NEP: Tamil Nadu Fights for Educational Autonomy</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Tamil Nadu government, led by CM MK Stalin, is opposing key aspects of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, including the three-language formula, Common University Entrance Test (CUET), and Multiple Entry-Exit System. Stalin argues these provisions threaten Tamil Nadu's linguistic and educational autonomy, claiming they impose Hindi and Sanskrit while endangering the Tamil language and culture.  

He has criticized the Centre for linking the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and PM SHRI Schools with NEP and urged PM Modi to release SSA funds.  Stalin cites constitutional provisions stating education falls under the Concurrent List, granting states significant authority in the matter.">
