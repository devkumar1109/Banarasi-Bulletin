    <meta name="description" content="To address increasing crowd congestion in Varanasi, the Varanasi Municipal Corporation presented a data-driven plan developed by Toyota Mobility Foundation, WRI India, and Urban Lab.  

The plan, based on surveys conducted over the past few months, highlights significantly increased crowd levels after 2023, especially during festivals like Dev Deepawali and Maha Shivaratri.  

The most crowded areas are from the church to Dashashwamedh ghat, Godowlia to Maidagin, and the Assi area.  The plan suggests crowd mapping, creating a holding area in Beniabagh, and advanced crowd growth assessments.
