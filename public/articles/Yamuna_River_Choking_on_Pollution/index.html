    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Yamuna River Choking on Pollution</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A parliamentary panel found that 23 out of 33 monitored sites along the Yamuna River, including six in Delhi, failed to meet primary water quality standards.  Dissolved oxygen levels, crucial for aquatic life, were nearly non-existent in the Delhi stretch. Despite upgrades to sewage treatment plants, pollution levels remain high. 

The panel highlighted that while four sites in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh met water quality standards, all six sites in Haryana failed.  In Delhi, one site showed improvement in recent years. Encroachments on Yamuna floodplains are a concern, with Delhi and Haryana providing information but Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand lagging. The Delhi Development Authority has reclaimed some encroached land, but litigation hinders complete removal.">
