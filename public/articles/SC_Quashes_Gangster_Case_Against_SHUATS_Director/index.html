    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - SC Quashes Gangster Case Against SHUATS Director</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Supreme Court quashed criminal proceedings against Vinod Bihari Lal, Director of Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture Technology and Science (SHUATS), after finding that the FIR and chargesheet lacked independent application of mind. 

The court slammed the Uttar Pradesh Police for invoking the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986, against Lal, stating that continuation of the proceedings would result in undue harassment and abuse of process of law. 

The Supreme Court overturned the Allahabad High Court's April 2023 order, which had rejected Lal's plea to quash the FIR and refused to grant him relief.">
