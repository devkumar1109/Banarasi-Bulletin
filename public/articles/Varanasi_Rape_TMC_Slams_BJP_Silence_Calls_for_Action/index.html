    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Rape: TMC Slams BJP Silence, Calls for Action</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Trinamool Congress (TMC) is criticizing the BJP-led central government and women's rights organizations for their silence on the alleged gang rape of a 19-year-old woman in Varanasi.  AITC MP Saayoni Ghosh questioned the whereabouts of the "Beti Bachao" brigade and the National Commission for Women, highlighting the alleged inaction. The victim was reportedly missing since March 29 and allegedly assaulted by 23 individuals who recorded the act.  Thirteen individuals have been taken into custody. The TMC alleges that the incident exposes the hypocrisy of the BJP's "Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao" campaign, contrasting it with the TMC's proposed Aparajita Bill, which seeks stricter punishment for rapists and faster trials.">
