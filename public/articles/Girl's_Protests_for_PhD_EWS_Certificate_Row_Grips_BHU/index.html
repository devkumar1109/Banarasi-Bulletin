    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Girl's Protests for PhD, EWS Certificate Row Grips BHU</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Archita Singh, a girl from Ballia, is staging an indefinite sit-in at BHU's central office for over eight days to secure PhD (Hindi) admission under the EWS quota.  She claims she qualified for the program but the department is trying to eliminate her candidature by stating her EWS certificate is old.  Despite providing the certificate with an undertaking and necessary documents, the admission committee hasn't sent her the admission link.  

The protest has garnered attention from political parties like Samajwadi Party and UP Congress and caste-based organizations. Archita was hospitalized due to dehydration but returned to continue her protest. BHU officials have formed a committee to investigate if any admissions were made based on conditional certificates.">
