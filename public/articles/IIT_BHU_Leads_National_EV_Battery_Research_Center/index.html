    <meta name="description" content="The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) BHU has been chosen as a nodal center for national EV battery research under the government's MAHA-EV Mission. IIT-BHU will lead a facility focused on battery degradation diagnostics and the development of safe, sustainable, and efficient battery systems called Te-MobiX.  

The institute received a Rs55 crore grant to establish the National Facility for Battery Research on its campus.  The project, led by Prof. Amit Patra, involves collaborations with IIT Kharagpur, BHU, ICT Mumbai, and industry partners like Tata Motors and TVS Motors. Te-MobiX aims to address challenges specific to India's tropical climate, focusing on improving battery safety, lifespan, and performance.">
