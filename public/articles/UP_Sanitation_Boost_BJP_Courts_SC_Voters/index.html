    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Sanitation Boost: BJP Courts SC Voters</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has announced a ₹10,000 bonus and a minimum wage of ₹16,000 for the state's sanitation workers, effective April 2025. 

This move is seen as a strategic attempt to woo the Scheduled Caste (SC) voters ahead of the 2027 state elections.  The SC population in Uttar Pradesh constitutes about 20.7% of the total population, and traditionally forms a strong voter base for the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). 

If successful, this could significantly weaken the BSP's hold and impact the Samajwadi Party's (SP) resurgence.  The BJP hopes to capitalize on the move by securing the support of these communities, who are mostly employed as sanitation workers.">
