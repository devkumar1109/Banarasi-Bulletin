    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - $509 Million Drug Bust: Record Haul Foils Trafficking Route</title>
    <meta name="description" content="FBI Chief Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi announced a $509 million drug seizure at a Florida port, marking one of the largest in Florida's history. 

The bust included 45,000 pounds of cocaine, 3,800 pounds of marijuana, heroin, and fentanyl, intended for U.S. cities.  The operation targeted a major drug trafficking route and involved military, Department of Justice, and U.S. Coast Guard cooperation. 

The drugs were intercepted offshore near Peru, Ecuador, and the Galapagos Islands using drones, aircraft, and ships. Eleven prosecutions are expected in Florida's Middle District. 


Officials emphasized the operation's success in saving thousands of lives by preventing these drugs from reaching communities.">
