    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Mumbai Slums Under Siege: Death Sparks Crackdown</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Irani Basti, a settlement near Mumbai known for chain-snatching, is under scrutiny following the death of resident Jaffer Gulam Hussein Irani in a Chennai police encounter. 

The area has a history of violent resistance against police, with locals attacking and injuring officers. Authorities plan a combing operation in Irani Basti, potentially using bulldozers, to address the escalating crime. 

Irani Basti is home to around 2,000 people, some living illegally on government or railway land.  They have a history of criminal activity dating back to the early 20th century, with authorities characterizing them as a nomadic group with a propensity for crime.  The area's location outside Mumbai city limits makes it challenging for authorities to enforce law and order.">
