    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Gutkha Ban After MLA's Spitting Scandal</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh Assembly imposed a ban on chewing gutkha on its premises following an incident where an MLA spat paan masala on the carpet. Videos of the incident, captured by Assembly cameras, went viral, prompting Speaker Satish Mahana to oversee the cleaning and reprimand the MLA, though he chose not to publicly name him. Mahana stated that the MLA resolved the matter privately with him. This incident is not unique; in 2022, a video of a BJP MLA chewing tobacco in the Assembly was circulated, and in February 2023, the West Bengal Assembly proposed a bill imposing heavy fines for spitting tobacco and paan masala in public places.">
