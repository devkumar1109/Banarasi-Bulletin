    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Tiger Tourism Booms in Uttar Pradesh</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The seven-month ecotourism session in Uttar Pradesh's tiger reserves and wildlife sanctuaries ended on Sunday.  Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) saw a record 56,289 tourists this season, a significant increase from the previous year's 54,378.  This surge is attributed to increased tiger sightings, rich biodiversity, scenic beauty, and improved ecotourism management.  PTR's revenue also rose to ₹1.60 crore from ₹1.36 crore last year, with foreign tourist numbers doubling. 

Chuka, PTR's ecotourism site, drew in visitors with its "mini-Goa" vibe and unique boat safaris on the Sharda Sagar dam. However, Dr. Amitabh Agnihotri criticized the state's revenue-sharing model, which allocates 90% of ecotourism revenue to the UP Forest Corporation and only 10% to reserves, hindering conservation efforts.">
