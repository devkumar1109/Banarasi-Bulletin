    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Maurya Slams "Sindoor" Operation, Calls It Political Stunt</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Swami Prasad Maurya, a former UP minister and founder of a new political party, criticized India's recent military operation against Pakistan, Operation Sindoor. He called it a "political stunt" and accused the Modi government of misleading the nation under the guise of nationalism. Maurya claimed the operation lacked credibility and demanded evidence of neutralized terrorists. He also alleged that the government manipulated public sentiment by using the symbol "sindoor" to evoke emotional responses. Political experts believe Maurya's comments are a strategy to gain relevance by positioning himself as a fierce anti-establishment voice in UP.">
