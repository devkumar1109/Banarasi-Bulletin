    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi's Sewai: Eid's Sweet Harmony</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Varanasi, Hindu artisans have a long tradition of manufacturing sewai (vermicelli) for Muslim Eid celebrations.  The city's 'kimami' sewai, both raw and white varieties, is highly sought after during Eid.  Around 200 families in Varanasi are engaged in sewai production, with work intensifying two to three months before Ramzan.  

Varanasi's thin sewai, available in sizes 1, 2, and 0, is made using special refined flour and ghee, giving it a unique texture.  Demand for Banarasi sewai extends beyond India, with exporters fulfilling orders from other countries.  While sales are good during festivals like Holi and Bakrid, business peaks during Eid.  


The craftsmanship of Banarasi sewai is renowned for its finesse and cleanliness, with strands as fine as a hair.">
