    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi's Sewai: Eid's Sweet Harmony</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Varanasi, Hindu artisans have a long-standing tradition of producing sewai, a type of vermicelli, that is highly sought after during Muslim Eid celebrations. The city is known for its "kimami" sewai, both in raw and cooked varieties, which are popular for both Eid feasts and the pre-dawn meal of "sehri" during Ramadan. 

Around 200 families in Varanasi are involved in the sewai industry, with demand increasing two to three months before Ramadan. The thin, delicate sewai, made with refined flour and ghee, is unique to Varanasi and is exported to other countries.  Sales peak during Eid, but banarasi sewai is also popular during Holi and Bakrid.">
