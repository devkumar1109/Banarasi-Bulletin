    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Police: 180 Sub-Inspectors Fail Performance Review</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Over 150 Varanasi police sub-inspectors were sidelined for retraining after failing a first-ever commissionerate performance review. Of the 589 sub-inspectors evaluated, 107 scored zero, over 50 couldn't draft basic FIRs, and many struggled with public grievances.  100% failed to address complaints on the IGRS, the CM's public complaint dashboard. 180 officers were removed from field duties and attached to the police lines for intensive retraining. 444 passed, with six deemed "star performers". Retraining includes FIR writing, investigation techniques, public interaction protocols, and legal education, led by senior IPS officers.">
