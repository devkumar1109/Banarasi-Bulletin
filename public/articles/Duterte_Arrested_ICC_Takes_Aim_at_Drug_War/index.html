    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Duterte Arrested: ICC Takes Aim at Drug War</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested by the International Criminal Court (ICC) after a 12-hour standoff at his home in Davao City. The arrest stems from ICC charges of crimes against humanity related to Duterte's war on drugs, which resulted in numerous deaths. 

Duterte's legal team contends the arrest is illegal and politically motivated, vowing to challenge it in court. They argue the campaign targeted impoverished communities and disregarded legal procedures. The ICC will hold a hearing on September 23 to determine if there is sufficient evidence for a trial in The Hague.">
