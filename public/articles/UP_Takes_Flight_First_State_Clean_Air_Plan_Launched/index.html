    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Takes Flight: First State Clean Air Plan Launched</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh launched the Uttar Pradesh Clean Air Plan (UCAP), India's first state-level clean air strategy based on scientific analysis and an airshed-based approach. The 10-year plan aims to reduce PM2.5 levels by targeting household emissions, transport, industries, and agriculture. 

The plan utilizes data from Uttar Pradesh's emissions inventory and scientific modeling. It adopts an airshed management approach, recognizing that air pollution transcends urban and rural boundaries.  

The Uttar Pradesh Clean Air Management Project (UPCAMP), financed by a $320 million World Bank loan, will support UCAP implementation. UPCAMP focuses on strengthening institutional mechanisms, expanding air quality monitoring, and piloting clean air measures.">
