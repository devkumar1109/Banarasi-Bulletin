    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Farmers Embrace Modern Farming Tech</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A two-day training program on direct seeded rice (DSR) and zero tillage wheat (ZTW) was conducted in Varanasi for 70 farmers from Eastern Uttar Pradesh.  Experts from ISARC, IRRI, World Bank, Bayer Crop Science, and Savannah emphasized the need for agricultural transformation in the region and highlighted the benefits of DSR and ZTW, including reduced labor costs, water savings, and increased productivity. 

Farmers received training on nutrient and weed management, as well as mechanisation, with a focus on hybrid rice varieties, herbicide solutions, and mechanized services. A field visit to ISARC's Mechanisation Hub provided hands-on experience with seed drill calibration and equipment maintenance. 


The program aimed to equip farmers with the knowledge and confidence to implement these technologies effectively and foster stronger market linkages for enhanced profitability and sustainability.">
