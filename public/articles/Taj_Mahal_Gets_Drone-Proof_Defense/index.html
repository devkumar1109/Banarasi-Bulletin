    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Taj Mahal Gets Drone-Proof Defense</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Taj Mahal will soon be equipped with an anti-drone system to enhance security. This decision comes after heightened tensions following India's cross-border strikes on May 7th in response to the Pahalgam massacre. The system, with a range of 7-8 kilometers and primary effectiveness within 200 meters of the main dome, will jam drone signals, rendering them inoperable. A dedicated police team is being trained to operate the equipment and respond to drone incursions. Installation is expected to be completed in the coming days.  This upgrade is a response to growing concerns about drones being used in attacks on high-profile sites.">
