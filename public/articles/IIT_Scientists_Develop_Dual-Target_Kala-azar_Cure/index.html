    <meta name="description" content="Researchers from IIT-BHU, Varanasi, and IIT Guwahati have developed novel dual-target drugs for treating visceral leishmaniasis (Kala-azar). 

The drugs, encapsulated in advanced liposomes, inhibit two crucial enzymes, FeSODA and TryR, essential for the parasite's survival. 

This dual-target approach enhances therapeutic success and reduces resistance risk. 

Laboratory testing showed promising results, with the drugs inducing apoptosis-like cell death in the parasite. 

The team will conduct preclinical and clinical trials to make the treatment available for affected communities.">
