    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Caste Census: BJP's Political Gambit in UP, Bihar</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The NDA government's announcement of a caste census alongside the next population census has significant political implications, particularly in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The BJP aims to counter opposition accusations of being against backwards and Dalit communities by embracing the caste census demand. This move comes in response to pressure from opposition parties like the Samajwadi Party and Congress, who have been highlighting the need for a caste census and increased representation for OBCs and Dalits.  

The BJP hopes  the announcement will preempt any negative labels, similar to the withdrawal of controversial farm laws. The timing of the announcement, coinciding with anticipation about the Pahalgam terrorist attack, suggests an attempt by the government to control the narrative and avoid opposition taking credit for the decision. Opposition leaders, like Akhilesh Yadav, claim this victory is a result of pressure from marginalized communities.">
