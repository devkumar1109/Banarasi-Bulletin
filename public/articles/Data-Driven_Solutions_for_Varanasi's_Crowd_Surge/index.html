    <meta name="description" content="To manage increasing crowds in Varanasi, the Varanasi Municipal Corporation presented a data-driven plan developed by Toyota Mobility Foundation, WRI India, and Urban Lab.  

The plan, based on surveys conducted over several months, revealed significant crowd increases after 2023, particularly during festivals like Dev Deepawali and Maha Shivaratri. The most crowded areas are from the church to Dashashwamedh ghat, Godowlia to Maidagin, and the Assi area. 

The plan proposes testing data through crowd mapping, creating a holding area in Beniabagh, and pre-assessing crowd growth.
