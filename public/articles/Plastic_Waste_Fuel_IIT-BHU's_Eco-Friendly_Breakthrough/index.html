    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Plastic Waste Fuel: IIT-BHU's Eco-Friendly Breakthrough</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Researchers at IIT-BHU have developed a method to convert plastic waste into fuel oil using a patented multiphase catalytic pyrolysis reactor.  

The reactor utilizes low-cost natural catalysts made from river clay and can process polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene plastics into diesel and kerosene-range fuels. 

This eco-friendly technology addresses the environmental problems caused by plastic waste in urban areas like Varanasi, such as waterlogging, animal deaths, and soil/water contamination. 

The technology has received an Indian patent and recognition in international journals, and the team is now working on scaling it for commercial production. IIT-BHU Director Prof Amit Patra lauded the research as a significant contribution to sustainable development.">
