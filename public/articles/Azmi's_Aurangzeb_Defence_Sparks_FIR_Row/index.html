    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Azmi's Aurangzeb Defence Sparks FIR Row</title>
    <meta name="description" content="An FIR has been registered against Maharashtra SP leader Abu Azmi for his remarks defending Mughal ruler Aurangzeb. Azmi claimed Aurangzeb was not cruel, citing examples of temple construction and saving a Hindu girl. 

He argued that power struggles during Aurangzeb's era were political, not religious, and his army included Hindus. Azmi's statement sparked controversy, drawing criticism from political leaders, including Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, who demanded an apology.

Shiv Sena MP Naresh Mhaske filed the complaint, leading to the FIR under sections 299, 302, 356(1), and 356(2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).">
