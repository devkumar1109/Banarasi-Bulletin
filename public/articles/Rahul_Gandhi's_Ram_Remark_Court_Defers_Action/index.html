    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Rahul Gandhi's Ram Remark: Court Defers Action</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A Varanasi court dismissed a complaint filed against Rahul Gandhi for his 'Lord Ram fictional' remark made in the US.  Advocate Harishankar Pandey filed the complaint, seeking an FIR against Gandhi for allegedly denigrating religious beliefs and inciting communal discord. The court rejected the complaint due to a lack of sanction from the Lok Sabha Speaker, a requirement for proceeding against an MP.  Pandey claims Gandhi made the remark on April 21 during an interaction at Brown University, calling Lord Ram a "mythological and fictional character." He plans to file a revision petition after seeking sanction from the Lok Sabha Speaker.">
