    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Embraces 3D Future: Smart City Takes Shape</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Varanasi is the first city in India to utilize 3D mapping technology for urban planning and development. The project, costing Rs six crore and completed in nine months, involved using LiDAR, 360-degree imagery, and drones to create a detailed 3D model of the 160 square kilometer area.  

This "3D Urban Spatial Digital Twin" provides a precise visual representation of the city, including its alleys, the Ganga river, temples, and key locations. 

The technology offers numerous benefits, such as:

-  Assessing flood levels in the Ganga and identifying vulnerable areas.
-  Evaluating the feasibility and availability of locations for development projects.
-  Enabling real-time crowd management, crime control, and traffic monitoring through connected cameras.
-  Improving waste management, sewage, and water management systems.
-  Supporting rescue operations and planning for future development.">
