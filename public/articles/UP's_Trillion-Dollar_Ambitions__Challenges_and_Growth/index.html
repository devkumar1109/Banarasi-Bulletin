    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath aims to transform the state into a trillion-dollar economy by 2029.  Despite claims of being the second-largest economy, UP's projected GDP for 2024-25 places it fifth, behind Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Gujarat.  

The state's unemployment rate at 2.4% is below the national average of 3.2%. Since 2018, UP has received ₹45 lakh crore in investment proposals with ₹15 lakh crore already implemented, creating 60 lakh jobs. 

To achieve the trillion-dollar goal, the government plans another Investors' Summit targeting ₹33 lakh crore in investments, aiming for ₹100 lakh crore by 2027.  Invest UP offices will be set up in Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore.  


Efforts are underway to digitize land use changes, create a GIS land bank, and tackle regional imbalances through the Bundelkhand Industrial Development Authority, which has been allocated ₹5,000 crore.">
