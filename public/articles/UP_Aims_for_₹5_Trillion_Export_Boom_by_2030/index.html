    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh aims to increase exports to over ₹5 trillion by 2030, nearly tripling its current outbound shipments. The state government is revamping its export policy for 2025-30, focusing on new markets in Latin America and Eastern Europe. 

The policy will include increased incentives for exporters and enhanced infrastructure support.  This move aligns with the Central government’s efforts to diversify exports beyond traditional markets. Uttar Pradesh, the second-largest state economy and a major contributor to GST collections, seeks to solidify its position as a key player in India's export landscape.">
