    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Police: Retraining After Performance Stumble</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Over 150 Varanasi police sub-inspectors were sidelined for retraining after failing the first commissionerate performance review. Out of 589 sub-inspectors evaluated, 107 scored zero, over 50 couldn't draft basic FIRs, and many performed poorly handling public grievances. 100% failed to properly address complaints on the IGRS (Integrated Grievance Redressal System). 

180 officers were stripped of field duties and attached to police lines for intensive retraining, which includes physical drills, legal education, and practical exercises. 444 earned passing marks, with six declared "star performers."  The commissioner emphasized that policing requires skill, sensitivity, and seriousness.  The retraining program covers FIR writing, public interaction, and new criminal laws like the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).">
