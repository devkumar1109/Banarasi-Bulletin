    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - ABVP Demands EWS Clarity, Accuses Political Interference</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The ABVP (student wing of the RSS) is demanding that BHU strictly follow central government guidelines for EWS reservations in the Hindi department's researcher admissions.  The call comes after two candidates challenged the validity of EWS certificates and the transparency of the admission process. ABVP accuses "political groups and anti-social elements" of trying to influence the inquiry and claims a misinformation campaign against their unit secretary.  

They urge the university to investigate departmental irregularities, take action against those responsible, and curb disruptive activities to maintain a safe academic environment.  The ABVP also accuses some political party-affiliated student organizations of exploiting admission process discrepancies to "pollute the academic atmosphere" and demands their ban from the campus.">
