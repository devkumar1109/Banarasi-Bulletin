    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Yadav's Kashmir Remarks Spark Political Firestorm</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Following the Pahalgam attack, Samajwadi Party leader Lal Bihari Yadav questioned the alleged intelligence failure, suggesting the attack might have been politically motivated. He also raised doubts about the Pulwama attack in 2019, questioning who carried it out. 

BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla condemned Yadav's remarks, accusing him of speaking for Pakistan and undermining security forces' morale. Poonawalla claimed the opposition is providing a clean chit to Pakistan by casting doubt on the attack's perpetrators. 

This incident follows similar controversial statements from other opposition leaders like Ajay Rai and Charanjeet Singh Channi after the Pahalgam attack.  The Modi government convened an all-party meeting to inform political parties about the security situation.">
