    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Satanic Symbols Fuel Murder in Meerut</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, Sahil Shukla, accused of murdering ex-navy officer Saurabh Rajput, was found to have a room filled with satanic graffiti, tantric symbols, and devil drawings, suggesting a deep interest in black magic. 

Police believe Sahil's wife, Muskan Rastogi, and her lover, exploited his superstition.  Muskan allegedly manipulated Sahil into believing his deceased mother wanted Saurabh killed through fake Snapchat accounts. 

After drugging, stabbing, and dismembering Saurabh, the couple hid his body in a cement-filled drum before going on a 12-day holiday to Shimla. The investigation is ongoing, with police examining the occult elements in Sahil's room for potential connections to the crime.">
