    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Mahakumbh Toll Discrepancy, Killings, and Shifting Politics</title>
    <meta name="description" content="An investigation by BBC reveals at least 82 deaths from the January Mahakumbh Mela stampede, contradicting the Uttar Pradesh government's official toll of 37. Many families haven't received promised compensation. 

In Uttar Pradesh, police encounters are allegedly leading to extrajudicial killings.  Families in Kaushambi allege police conducted unlawful encounters, attempted to silence them with bribes, and targeted the same location: Goonghwa Ka Bagh.

Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena, previously known for his confrontational stance against the AAP-led government, has softened his tone since the BJP's February 2025 victory.">
