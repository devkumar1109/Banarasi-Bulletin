    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Hindi Row: BJP Blasts DMK's "Double Standards"</title>
    <meta name="description" content="BJP leader Tamilisai Soundarajan criticized DMK over the alleged removal of Hindi lettering from railway station nameboards in Pollachi, Tamil Nadu. She accused the DMK of  exploiting language politics and double standards, pointing out that DMK ministers' children study in CBSE schools where three languages are taught. 

Soundarajan challenged Chief Minister MK Stalin to reveal how many children of DMK leaders and ministers learn only two languages.  She claimed DMK uses Hindi for business but opposes it for the welfare of poor children. AIADMK MP M Thambidurai echoed similar sentiments, accusing the DMK of using the language issue as a political tool. Meanwhile, DMK cadres protested against the trilingual language system in Tamil Nadu.  


The Southern Railway has identified and registered a case against those responsible for defacing the nameboards.">
