    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Plants for a Greener Future on Earth Day</title>
    <meta name="description" content="On Earth Day, the Uttar Pradesh government announced its afforestation efforts using the Miyawaki method to create dense forests quickly.  They aim to absorb significant amounts of carbon dioxide through afforestation under the 'Upvan' policy. To combat plastic pollution, the state will construct 1,500 km of roads using single-use plastic, repurposing 2,000 tonnes of waste.  

The government is also promoting solar energy with the 'PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana' which has already reached over 10 lakh solar-powered homes.  Additionally, a scheme links arms licensing with tree planting, and educational initiatives on environmental awareness are being conducted among school children.">
