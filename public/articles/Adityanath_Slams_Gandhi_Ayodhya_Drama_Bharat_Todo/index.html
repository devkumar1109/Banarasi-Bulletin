He questioned the Congress party's governance over the past ten decades, stating that they did not prioritize making India a "Shresht Bharat." Adityanath contrasted this with the current government's achievements, highlighting initiatives like the Ram Mandir construction, abolition of triple talaq, and promotion of the Kumbh Mela, which he claimed have garnered support from the entire nation under PM Modi.">
