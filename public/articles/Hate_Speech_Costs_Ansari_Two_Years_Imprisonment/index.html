    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Hate Speech Costs Ansari Two Years Imprisonment</title>
    <meta name="description" content="SBSP MLA Abbas Ansari was sentenced to two years imprisonment for a hate speech incident during the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. The Chief Judicial Magistrate (MP-MLA) court in Mau stated that there is no place for hate speech in public service, especially when it aims to influence elections. The court emphasized the seriousness of threatening election officials, as it instills fear among voters. 

The judgment noted Ansari's criminal history and his family's long-standing political influence in Mau Sadar. Ansari had threatened state government officials from a public meeting, vowing to hold them accountable for their actions during the previous regime. The court deemed this threat a potential disruption to communal harmony and decided against a lesser punishment.">
