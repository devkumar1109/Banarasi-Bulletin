    <meta name="description" content="Wheat procurement in Varanasi division has significantly increased this year by 3,746.88 metric tons compared to 2024, reaching 9,711.59 metric tons across four districts. The government is prioritizing farmer welfare through direct procurement at fair prices, saving them transportation costs and avoiding middlemen.  

Mobile vans are purchasing crops door-to-door, and payments are made within 48 hours to farmers' Aadhaar-linked accounts.  The support price is Rs 2,425 per quintal, Rs 150 higher than last year, with an additional Rs 20 per quintal credited for cleaning and sieving. Verification is waived for sales up to 100 quintals. The government aims to procure 127,500 metric tons of wheat in the division.">
