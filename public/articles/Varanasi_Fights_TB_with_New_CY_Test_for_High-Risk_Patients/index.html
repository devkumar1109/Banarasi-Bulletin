    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Fights TB with New CY Test for High-Risk Patients</title>
    <meta name="description" content="To combat tuberculosis, Varanasi has launched CY TB tests for high-risk individuals visiting hospitals. These include those with silicosis, undergoing dialysis or chemotherapy, and individuals with diabetes, malnutrition, smoking or alcohol consumption habits.  

CY TB tests involve an intradermal injection with results evaluated within 48-72 hours.  A positive result (induration greater than 5 mm) indicates TB infection and the individual receives preventive treatment (TPT).  

Approximately 15,000 doses of CY TB have been allocated to Varanasi. The goal is to increase the annual decline in TB incidence from 2.5% to 10%, ultimately aiming to make Varanasi TB-free.">
