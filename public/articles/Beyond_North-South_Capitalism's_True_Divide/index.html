    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Beyond North-South: Capitalism's True Divide</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The author argues that the "North vs. South" narrative in India is a distraction from the real issue: corporate capitalism. Despite progressive social movements and leadership in the South, regional inequality persists within Southern states, indicating deeper structural problems.  

The author points to the "BIMARU" regions within Southern states, highlighting disparities in literacy and income even within these states. This suggests that factors common to both North and South contribute to underdevelopment, such as a capitalist economic system that benefits developed regions at the expense of less developed ones.  

The author critiques the Modi government's policies, including delimitation, as potentially exacerbating the imbalance of power between North and South. They call for addressing the root causes of underdevelopment, such as colonial and post-colonial economic structures, rather than focusing on regional divides.">
