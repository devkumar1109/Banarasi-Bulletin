    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Tamil Nadu's Three-Language Standoff</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The article discusses the political debate surrounding the three-language formula in the Indian education system.  Tamil Nadu, led by Chief Minister MK Stalin, opposes the formula, seeing it as a potential push for Hindi dominance and a threat to Tamil linguistic identity. 

The author argues that this opposition is politically motivated, aiming to mobilize voters through language-based emotions.  The three-language formula, however, is not new, having been discussed during British rule and advocated for by Mahatma Gandhi.  Gandhi envisioned Hindi as a primary language with regional languages learned alongside, aiming to foster connections between them.  NEP 2020 draws inspiration from Gandhi's ideas, particularly his "Nai Talim" or Basic Education model, which emphasized education in the mother tongue until eighth grade.">
