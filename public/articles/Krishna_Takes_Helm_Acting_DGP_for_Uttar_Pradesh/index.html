    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Krishna Takes Helm: Acting DGP for Uttar Pradesh</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Rajeev Krishna, a 1991-batch IPS officer, has been appointed the acting Director General of Police (DGP) of Uttar Pradesh, succeeding Prashant Kumar. 

Krishna, known for his integrity and innovative policing approach, previously served as director general of vigilance and chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Police Recruitment and Promotion Board. He has held key positions like SSP in Agra, Lucknow, and Bareilly, and is recognized for his decisive action against kidnapping gangs. 

Krishna also founded the Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terror Squad and implemented technology-driven policing initiatives.  

This marks the fifth consecutive "acting" appointment since May 2022, when Mukul Goel was removed as permanent DGP for "neglect of duty."">
