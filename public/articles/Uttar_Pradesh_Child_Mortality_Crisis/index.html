    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Uttar Pradesh: Child Mortality Crisis</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh has the second highest child mortality rate in India, with 43 deaths per 1,000 births, according to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's Annual Health Report (2024-25).  The infant mortality rate (IMR) is 38 per 1,000 live births, and the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) is 28 per 1,000, both higher than the national averages.  

Most child deaths (63%) occur in the neonatal stage, with 75% happening within the first week.  Unsafe deliveries are a major factor, with infections like neonatal sepsis being a leading cause of newborn deaths.

The government is addressing this crisis through schemes like Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) and Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK), which promote institutional deliveries and provide free healthcare for newborns.  Newborn Care Corners (NBCCs) have also been established in delivery facilities to strengthen newborn care infrastructure.">
