    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Ganga Expressway: AI-Powered, Air-Ready, and Rapid</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Ganga Expressway, connecting Meerut and Prayagraj, is nearing completion and expected to be inaugurated in November 2023.  It is expected to reduce travel time between the two cities to six hours. The expressway features a first-of-its-kind airstrip in Shahjahanpur, where the Indian Air Force recently conducted successful night combat drills with Rafale, Sukhoi, and Mirage jets. To ensure road quality and minimize accidents, the Uttar Pradesh government is implementing Swiss AI and sensor technology from ETH Zurich and RTDT Labs. This technology detects and fixes road defects during construction, saving time and costs.">
