    <meta name="description" content="Rajan Singh, a man from Sonbhadra, has been arrested for posing as an excise officer and marrying multiple women.  He is accused of defrauding at least eight to nine women, many of whom are schoolteachers, of large sums of money.  

One victim, Kiran from Sant Kabir Nagar, alleges that Rajan married her in 2019 and convinced her to take a loan of Rs 42 lakh, which he then absconded with. Another victim, Sarita from Ambedkarnagar, claims Rajan married her in 2014, took Rs 10 lakh from her, and prevented her from visiting his home. Police are investigating further to uncover the extent of Rajan's deception and identify additional victims.">
