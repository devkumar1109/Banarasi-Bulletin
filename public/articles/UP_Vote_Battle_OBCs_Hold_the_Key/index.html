    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Vote Battle: OBCs Hold the Key</title>
    <meta name="description" content="With the 2027 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections in sight, all major political parties are focusing on wooing the OBC vote. 

The BJP, while organizing its ranks, claims to be ensuring 50% representation of OBCs, SCs, and women in its state units.  However, the initial appointments of 70 district chiefs show a higher proportion of Brahmins than OBCs.  The BJP relies on allies like SBSP, Apna Dal, NISHAD Party, and RLD to consolidate OBC support. 

The Samajwadi Party, riding on its PDA (Pichda, Dalit, Alpsankhyak) plank in the recent Lok Sabha polls, has launched the "PDA charcha" campaign across the state.   The BSP has revived its "Bhaichara Committees" to connect with OBC voters.">
