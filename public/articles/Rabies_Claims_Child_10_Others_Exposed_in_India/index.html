    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Rabies Claims Child, 10 Others Exposed in India</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A three-year-old boy in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, died from suspected rabies after being bitten by a rabid dog over a month ago.  Ten other children, also bitten by the same dog, remain untreated.  

The boy's death prompted a health emergency, with local authorities launching a preventive campaign and distributing anti-rabies vaccines.  

While the boy's death is considered serious, medical confirmation of rabies is pending as he was not tested before death and the dog was killed without examination. The district's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Neeraj Tyagi, urged the public to seek immediate medical attention after any animal bite. 


The incident highlights a lack of awareness and access to post-bite care in rural areas.">
