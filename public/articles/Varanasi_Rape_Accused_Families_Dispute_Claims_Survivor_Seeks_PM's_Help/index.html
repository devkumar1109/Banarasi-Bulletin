    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Rape: Accused Families Dispute Claims, Survivor Seeks PM's Help</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A 19-year-old woman in Varanasi alleged she was gang-raped by 23 people between March 29 and April 4. 14 of the accused have been arrested, while the remaining arrests are pending a Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe.  

The families of some accused claim the woman demanded money to remove names from the complaint, questioned her silence during the alleged assault, and highlighted her social media activity during that time. They also allege inconsistencies in her account, pointing to her initial naming of 23 individuals and later identifying only nine in court testimony.

The survivor's mother wishes to meet PM Modi during his visit to Varanasi to seek justice and harsher punishment for the perpetrators.">
