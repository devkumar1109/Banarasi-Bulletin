    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Holi Hijack: Train Halted to Avoid Color Clash</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In 1999, during Holi, the administration in Mau, Uttar Pradesh, temporarily halted a train carrying Haj pilgrims to Delhi to prevent them from being exposed to Holi revelers.  The decision, described in former UP DGP O.P. Singh's book "Through My Eyes," was made to avoid potential communal tensions as the pilgrims were dressed in white while Holi involved throwing colored powders and water.

The administration requested the Indian Railways to delay the train, but the Railways refused, citing operational punctuality. Due to this, the administration issued a prohibitory order under Section 144 CrPC to stop the train, a first in India's history where the law was used to halt a moving train.">
