    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Priest, Politician, and the Power of Faith</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Dhirendra Krishna Shastri, head priest of Bageshwar Dham, has gained significant political influence, dubbed by PM Modi as his "younger brother."  Shastri's religious complex draws lakhs of devotees, and he claims supernatural abilities.  Initially focused on religious devotion, Shastri has adopted a hardline Hindutva stance, advocating for a Hindu nation and urging Hindu unity against conversions. 

His influence is seen as strong in Bundelkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Jharkhand. Both Congress and BJP leaders have attempted to court Shastri, with the BJP benefiting more from the association.  Shastri's rise began with support from former Congress MLA Alok Chaturvedi, and prominent Congress leader Kamal Nath was among the first high-profile figures to engage with him.">
