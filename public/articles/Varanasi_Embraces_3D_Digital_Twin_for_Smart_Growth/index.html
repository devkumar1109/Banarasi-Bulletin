    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Embraces 3D Digital Twin for Smart Growth</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Varanasi has become the first city in India to utilize a large-scale 3D model for urban planning and development. The 3D Urban Spatial Digital Twin project, worth Rs six crore, took nine months to complete and uses cutting-edge GIS technology, including LiDAR, 360-degree imagery, and 3D modeling. 

The model encompasses a 160 square kilometer area, showcasing the city's infrastructure, including alleys, the Ganga river, temples, and key locations. 

This technology will aid in sustainable development, flood level predictions, precise measurements for development plans, crowd management, crime control, traffic monitoring, and efficient waste and water management.">
