    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - AI X-Rays Boost TB Detection in Uttar Pradesh</title>
    <meta name="description" content="AI-powered, hand-held X-ray machines are significantly impacting tuberculosis (TB) detection in Uttar Pradesh, India.  These portable devices have facilitated the diagnosis of 6.8 lakh TB patients in a year, setting a new record for the state.  

As part of the national 100-Day Intensified Campaign to Eliminate TB, these machines are enabling low-radiation screenings, even in remote areas, targeting high-risk groups. The campaign has screened 3.5 crore individuals and diagnosed 1.7 lakh TB patients since its December launch.  

Early detection is crucial to prevent TB spread, as a single untreated patient can infect many others.  Contact tracing and preventive treatment are used to curb transmission chains within vulnerable populations.">
