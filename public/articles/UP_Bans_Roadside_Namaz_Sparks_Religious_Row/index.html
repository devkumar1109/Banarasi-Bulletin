    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Bans Roadside Namaz, Sparks Religious Row</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh government has sparked controversy by prohibiting Namaz on roads and rooftops during Alvida Jumma (the last Friday of Ramadan) and Eid-ul-Fitr in several districts. Officials cite public safety, accident prevention, and traffic management as reasons.  

Opposition leaders and sections of the Muslim community criticize the move, viewing it as an infringement on religious practice and a clash between law, faith, and politics.  

The government has designated alternative prayer spaces, including mosques, Eidgahs, and open grounds. However, some worshippers express concern over the limited capacity of these designated areas.  

Despite the controversy, prayers on Alvida Jumma concluded peacefully, with heavy police presence in sensitive locations.">
