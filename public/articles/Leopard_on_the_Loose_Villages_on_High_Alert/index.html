    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Leopard on the Loose: Villages on High Alert</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Following a leopard attack that injured three people in Varanasi last week, 12 villages along the Ganga river are on high alert. The leopard, suspected to have come from Chandauli or Kaimur Wildlife Sanctuary, remains at large despite a search operation by joint forest teams from Varanasi and Chandauli. The injured are in stable condition. 

Villagers are taking precautions, avoiding venturing out after dark and keeping night vigils with sticks and firecrackers.  The forest department has deployed guards, installed nets and cages, and conducted intensive combing operations. The leopard was last seen on Friday hiding in bushes and has not been sighted since.">
