    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Leopard on the Loose: Villages on High Alert</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Following a leopard attack that injured three people in Varanasi last week, 12 villages along the Ganga river have been placed on high alert.  

The leopard was last seen on Friday hiding in bushes, but it evaded capture despite trapping efforts by the forest department. Authorities suspect it may have come from Chandauli or the Kaimur Wildlife Sanctuary. 

The injured individuals are currently stable in the hospital. Joint forest teams from Varanasi and Chandauli are conducting search operations and advising villagers to exercise caution. 

While the leopard hasn't been sighted since Friday, villagers remain fearful, with children and the elderly advised to stay indoors.  The forest department has deployed guards, nets, and cages, and is conducting intensive combing operations.">
