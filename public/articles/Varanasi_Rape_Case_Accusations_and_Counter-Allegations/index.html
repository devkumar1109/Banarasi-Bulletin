    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Rape Case: Accusations and Counter-Allegations</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A 19-year-old woman in Varanasi alleges she was gang raped by 23 individuals between March 29 and April 4.  She accused them in an FIR filed on April 6. Police arrested 14 individuals, with 11 of the 12 identified accused in custody. 

The families of the accused counterclaim, alleging the woman extorted money from them and presenting videos as evidence. They claim the videos show her in "questionable postures" at ghats and public locations between March 29 and April 4. They also question why she didn't report the alleged rapes sooner. 

A 6-member SIT led by a DCP rank officer has been formed to investigate both the rape allegations and the counterclaims.">
