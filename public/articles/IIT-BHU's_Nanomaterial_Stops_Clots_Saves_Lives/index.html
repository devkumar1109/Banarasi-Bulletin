    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT-BHU's Nanomaterial Stops Clots, Saves Lives</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Researchers at IIT-BHU have developed Potassium Ferric Oxalate Nanoparticle (KFeOx-NPs), a novel material that prevents blood clotting and thrombosis without affecting blood structure.  

This breakthrough aims to combat blood clot-related disorders like strokes, heart attacks, and pulmonary embolism, which are leading causes of mortality. 

KFeOx-NPs are more effective and safer than conventional anticoagulants like warfarin and heparin, which have side effects such as excessive bleeding. 

Tested on human blood samples, KFeOx-NPs prevented clotting for up to 48 hours and showed efficacy in a mouse model. 

The findings were published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, and a patent has been filed for the nanomaterial.">
