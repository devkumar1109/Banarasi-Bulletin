    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Cross-Border Strikes: New Regional Security Threat</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In January 2024, Iran conducted a drone strike in Pakistan's Balochistan province, killing two children, in retaliation for an attack by Jaish ul-Adl militants. Pakistan responded with its own strikes in Iran. By 2025, India initiated "Operation Sindoor" following a terror attack in Kashmir, mirroring Iran's earlier actions. Both countries justified their cross-border strikes as responses to terrorism. This shift in regional tactics highlights a growing trend of countries taking direct action against threats beyond their borders, increasing regional tensions and raising questions about future diplomatic relations.  This approach, characterized by a willingness to confront threats directly, could influence other nations facing similar challenges, potentially impacting regional politics and alliances.">
