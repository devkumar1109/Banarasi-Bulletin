    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Modi: Youth, Unity, and Progress Over Appeasement</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at the CNN-News18 Rising Bharat Summit 2025, emphasized the importance of youth aspirations in shaping India's future politics. He contrasted his approach, focused on development and unity, with what he described as the "politics of appeasement" that burdened the nation with 20th-century ideologies.  

Modi criticized the Congress-led UPA's 2013 Waqf amendment, alleging it favored Islamists and empowered land mafias. He highlighted the new amendment passed last week, which aims to protect waqf land and the interests of marginalized communities.  

Without naming Rahul Gandhi, Modi subtly criticized the opposition's focus on caste census and minority politics, emphasizing inclusivity as both a promise and a policy. He asserted that India's path to 2047 should be marked by continuous deliberation and fearless progress.">
