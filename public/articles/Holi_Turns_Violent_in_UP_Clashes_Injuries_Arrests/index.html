    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Holi Turns Violent in UP: Clashes, Injuries, Arrests</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Holi celebrations in Uttar Pradesh were marred by violence, resulting in injuries and arrests across several districts. Clashes stemmed from caste-based disputes, forced color application, and alcohol-fueled altercations.  

In Mathura, ten people were injured in a village altercation, while Farrukhabad saw six injuries from a shooting incident linked to Holi rituals. A clash with police in Kaushambi led to an officer's assault.  

Other incidents included fires in Sant Kabir Nagar stemming from music disputes, fatal clashes in Sultanpur, and a Holi-related death in Barabanki. Police presence has been increased in affected areas.">
