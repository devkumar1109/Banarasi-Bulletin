    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - SP Vows Change: Justice for the Underprivileged</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav accused the Uttar Pradesh government of neglecting the poor, backward classes, Dalits, and minorities.  He alleged that the BJP government has failed to deliver justice to these communities and has instead spread hatred to consolidate its support base. Yadav promised that an SP government in 2027 would restore responsive governance and ensure benefits of government schemes reach the underprivileged. He predicted a political shift in the 2027 assembly elections, with the SP, termed the "PDA" (Pichhde, Dalit, Alpsankhyak), ousting the BJP from power. Yadav demanded a caste census, emphasizing its importance for social justice and fair representation. He also pledged to phase out outsourced jobs and restore the old pension scheme.">
