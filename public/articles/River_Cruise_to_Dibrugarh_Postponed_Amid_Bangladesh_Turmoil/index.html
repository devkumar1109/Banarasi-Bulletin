    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - River Cruise to Dibrugarh Postponed Amid Bangladesh Turmoil</title>
    <meta name="description" content="India has postponed the world's longest river cruise from Varanasi to Dibrugarh via Dhaka due to political instability in Bangladesh.  

The cruise, operating on the 3,200-km India-Bangladesh Protocol (IBP) route, has seen reduced interest from foreign tourists following travel advisories issued after the ousting of the Sheikh Hasina government.  

While cargo movement on the IBP route continues, passenger services are currently suspended.

The cruise, which started in January 2023, has only ferried around 60 passengers until now.  

Officials state the cruise will resume once Bangladesh's political situation stabilizes.">
