    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Ballia Strikes Oil: ONGC Unveils Ganga Basin Riches</title>
    <meta name="description" content="ONGC has discovered crude oil reserves in Ballia, Uttar Pradesh, after a three-month survey in the Ganga basin. The reserves were found at a depth of 3,000 meters on land leased from the family of freedom fighter Chittu Pandey. Drilling, requiring 25,000 liters of water daily, has commenced and is expected to be completed by April 2025.  If commercially viable, ONGC plans to drill more wells in the 300-km oil belt and acquire more land, benefiting local farmers.  This discovery has the potential to boost the region's economy and establish Ballia as a key oil-producing area.">
