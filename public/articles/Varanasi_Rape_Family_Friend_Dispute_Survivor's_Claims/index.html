    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Rape: Family, Friend Dispute Survivor's Claims</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The family of an accused in the Varanasi gang rape case and a woman claiming to be the victim's friend dispute the survivor's allegations, calling them fabricated. The friend claims the survivor previously expressed a desire to go out and socialize, and didn't mention any assault during brief contacts. She also suggests the survivor had health issues unrelated to the alleged rape. The accused's sister claims the victim wanted to marry her brother, but he declined, leading to strained relations. Twelve individuals, including Raj Vishwakarma, have been arrested. Police are investigating the case and seeking the remaining suspects. Prime Minister Modi directed authorities to act promptly and decisively after the case gained national attention.">
