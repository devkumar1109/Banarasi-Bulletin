    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath defended his administration's warning against street prayers, stating roads are for traffic and Muslims should learn discipline from Hindus during the Kumbh Mela.

Adityanath dismissed discrimination claims, asserting Muslims benefit disproportionately from government welfare schemes. He defended his "bulldozer model," claiming it's necessary for both infrastructure development and encroachment removal, and that Uttar Pradesh's guidelines have been praised by the Supreme Court.">
