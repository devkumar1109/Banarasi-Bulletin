    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BJP Revamps Ahead of Presidential Vote, Court Ruling Looms</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The BJP is preparing for an organizational revamp ahead of electing a new president. Nominations are likely to begin after April 20. State presidents have been finalized for 15 states, with six or seven more expected to be announced by April 19, including Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka. 

The BJP leadership is reportedly concerned about the Supreme Court's recent judgment regarding the Tamil Nadu Governor's powers to reserve Bills for presidential consideration. The court deemed the Governor's actions "illegal and erroneous" and set timelines for presidential decisions on reserved Bills. 


While some in the government view the judgment as judicial overreach, others within the BJP are analyzing its implications.">
