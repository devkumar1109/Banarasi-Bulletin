    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Dalit Vote Splits: BSP Loses Grip in UP</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Dalit politics in Uttar Pradesh is undergoing a significant shift due to the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)'s declining influence. The BSP's vote share has plummeted from over 30% in 2007 to 9.3% in the 2024 Lok Sabha election, leaving Dalit voters divided. 

The BSP faces internal power struggles and has witnessed the departure of several senior leaders who have joined the BJP, Congress, or Samajwadi Party (SP). 

Dalit votes are now distributed among four key players: the BSP with 9%, the BJP with a growing share of non-Jatav Dalit votes, the SP-Congress combine, and Chandrashekhar Azad's Aazad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram). 


The SP's focus on "Pichchda, Dalit, Alpasankhyak" has attracted a significant portion of Dalit voters.">
