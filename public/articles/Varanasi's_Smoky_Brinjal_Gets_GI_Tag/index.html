    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi's Smoky Brinjal Gets GI Tag</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Ramnagar Bhanta, a brinjal variety from Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, received a GI tag in 2023.  Cultivated in Varanasi, Mirzapur, Chandauli, and Sonbhadra districts, it is prized for its large size (2-2.5 kg), rich, slightly smoky flavor, and nutritional value. 

Its smooth, dense flesh cooks into a creamy texture, making it ideal for dishes like bati-chokha. The brinjal changes from greenish-white to golden yellow as it ripens, signaling its readiness for seed extraction, a traditional farming practice.
