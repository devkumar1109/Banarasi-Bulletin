    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Liquor Rush: BOGO Deals Before Policy Shift</title>
    <meta name="description" content="To clear existing inventory before a new liquor policy takes effect on April 1, 2025, liquor shops across Uttar Pradesh are offering "buy one, get one free" deals and other discounts. This is because the state government has introduced an e-lottery system for allocating liquor vending licenses, replacing the previous practice of renewals for existing vendors. 

The new policy also introduces composite liquor shops selling both beer and IMFL, and changes to packaging and licensing fees. 

Liquor traders are concerned about potential financial losses due to unsold stock and have petitioned the government to take back the remaining inventory by March 31.">
