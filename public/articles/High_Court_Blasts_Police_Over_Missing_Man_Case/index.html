    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - High Court Blasts Police Over Missing Man Case</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Allahabad High Court has criticized police inaction in abduction cases, warning that officers could be held personally responsible if a missing person dies due to delays. 

The court was hearing a case where a man has been missing since March 31, 2025, allegedly abducted in Varanasi. Despite an FIR filed on April 3, the victim remains untraced. 

The court expressed concern over a "disturbing trend" of police apathy and noted their tendency to build a "larger-than-life image" to avoid accountability.  

The Commissioner of Police, Varanasi, has been directed to personally file an affidavit explaining the delay in recovering the missing man.">
