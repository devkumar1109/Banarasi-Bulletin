    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BJP Slams SP for Dalit Oppression, Praises Modi's Support</title>
    <meta name="description" content="BJP state general secretary Dharampal Singh accused the previous Samajwadi Party government under Akhilesh Yadav of oppressing Dalits and filing false cases against them. He claimed that the SP government's policies, including Muslim appeasement and caste-based division, were detrimental to Dalits and SC/ST communities. 

Singh contrasted this with the BJP's commitment to the upliftment of SC/ST, citing examples like Prime Minister Modi's respect for sanitation workers and the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. He also highlighted the BJP's efforts in ensuring representation of SC/ST in high positions and strengthening their constitutional rights, including reservations.">
