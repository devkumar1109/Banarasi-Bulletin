    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Boosts Alcohol Sales with New Excise Policy</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh's new excise policy for 2025-26 has come into effect, introducing several key changes.  

Foreign liquor and beer shops have been replaced with composite shops, increasing retail density. Composite shops meeting certain conditions can become model shops, serving liquor to customers. Country liquor shops can now sell beer. 

Low-alcoholic bars serving beer and wine only are introduced in Noida, Ghaziabad, Agra, and Lucknow. Bars and premium retail vends can be opened in large IT and ITeS establishments. Liquor tasting is allowed in wineries, breweries, and distilleries, and retail shops can be opened within these facilities. 

A new 90 ml category has been added to the IMFL regular category.  For the first time in seven years, all liquor shops, cannabis shops, composite shops, and model shops will be allotted through an e-lottery system.">
