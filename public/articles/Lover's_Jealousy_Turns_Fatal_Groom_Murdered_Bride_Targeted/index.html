    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Lover's Jealousy Turns Fatal: Groom Murdered, Bride Targeted.</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Mohd Saddam, 26, was arrested in Rampur, Uttar Pradesh, for murdering Nihal, a groom-to-be, the day before his wedding. Saddam confessed to killing Nihal out of unrequited love for the bride, Gulbasha. He lured Nihal out posing as Gulbasha's cousin and strangled him with an accomplice, Mohd Farman, 24. CCTV footage led police to identify Saddam, who confessed and led them to Nihal's body and phone. During arrest, Saddam snatched a police officer's pistol and fired, resulting in a retaliatory shot that injured his leg.  An FIR has been registered against Saddam and Farman for murder and destruction of evidence.">
