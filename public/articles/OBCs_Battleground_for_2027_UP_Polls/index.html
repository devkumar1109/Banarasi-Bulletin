    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - OBCs: Battleground for 2027 UP Polls</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Ahead of the 2027 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, all major political parties are focusing on wooing the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), who constitute about half of the state's population and hold sway in a significant number of constituencies. 

The BJP, undergoing an organizational overhaul, appointed chiefs for 70 out of 98 district/city units in UP, claiming to ensure 50% representation for OBCs, SCs, and women. However, the initial list reflects limited representation from these groups. The BJP relies on its allies – SBSP, Apna Dal (Sonelal), NISHAD Party, and the RLD – to consolidate OBC votes.

The Samajwadi Party (SP), a key member of the INDIA bloc, has launched the "PDA charcha" campaign, aiming to engage with OBCs, Dalits, and minorities.  The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has revived its "Bhaichara Committees" to connect with OBC voters.">
