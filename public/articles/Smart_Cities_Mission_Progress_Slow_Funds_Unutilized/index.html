    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Smart Cities Mission: Progress Slow, Funds Unutilized</title>
    <meta name="description" content="India's Smart Cities Mission, launched in 2015 to improve 100 selected cities, has seen only 18 out of 100 cities fully complete their projects by the March 31, 2025 deadline.  

While 7% of projects remain incomplete, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh lead with 5 and 4 fully transformed cities respectively. Telangana lags behind with only 62% of its 169 projects completed.

Unutilized funds remain a concern, with 22.93% in Telangana and over 50% in Manipur and 
Mizoram.  

The central government allocated Rs 48,000 crore, with matching funds from states, leaving Rs 1.5 trillion spent overall. Approximately Rs 60,000 crore was raised through PPPs, bonds, and government resources.">
