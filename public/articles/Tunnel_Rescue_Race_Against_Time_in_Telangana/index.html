    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Tunnel Rescue Race Against Time in Telangana</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Rescue operations are in the final stage for eight individuals trapped in a partially collapsed tunnel in Telangana's Nagarkurnool district. Multiple agencies, including the Army, Navy, NDRF, and SDRF, are involved in the effort, utilizing Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and specialized equipment to locate the trapped individuals.  

The operation faces challenges due to continuous water seepage. While the government has refuted claims of bodies being found, NGRI experts detected soft material under debris.  

The incident occurred on February 22nd, injuring two workers and trapping eight others, identified as Manoj Kumar, Sri Niwas, Sunny Singh, Gurpreet Singh, Sandeep Sahu, Jegta Xess, Santosh Sahu, and Anuj Sahau.">
