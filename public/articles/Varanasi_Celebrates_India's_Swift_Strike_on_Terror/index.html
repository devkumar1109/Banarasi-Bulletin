    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Celebrates India's Swift Strike on Terror.</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Following India's successful military operation, Operation Sindoor, against Pakistan on May 7, Varanasi locals erupted in celebration. The operation, a retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians, targeted nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, eliminating over 100 terrorists. 

Locals in PM Modi's constituency anointed a poster of him with 51 litres of milk and performed religious rituals, expressing their gratitude for his leadership. The operation involved 24 precision strikes on nine targets in 25 minutes, reportedly causing significant damage to Pakistan's air force infrastructure, including the destruction of fighter jets and airbases like Sargodha and Bholari. After four days of intense fighting, India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire.">
