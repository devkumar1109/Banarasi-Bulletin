    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Youth Duped: Cybercrime Trap in Myanmar</title>
    <meta name="description" content="21 youths from Uttar Pradesh, deported from Myanmar, revealed they were tricked into cybercrime. They were lured with promises of high-paying jobs in Thailand through Telegram by agents posing as recruiters. After passing a written exam and a Delhi interview, they received fake visas and were taken to Myawaddy, Myanmar, a cybercrime hub.

Their passports were confiscated, and they were forced to participate in scams involving impersonating police officers and executing fake "digital arrest" schemes. Resistance led to physical abuse, confinement, and ransom demands.  

The victims were trained to use WhatsApp, VOIP calls, and social media to target individuals from the US, Canada, Australia, and India, extorting money through threats and fake investment schemes. Many victims invested heavily, borrowing or selling assets, only to be scammed.">
