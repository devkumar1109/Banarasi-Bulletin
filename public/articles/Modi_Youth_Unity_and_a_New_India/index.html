    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Modi: Youth, Unity, and a New India</title>
    <meta name="description" content="At the CNN-News18 Rising Bharat Summit 2025, PM Modi delivered a keynote address, emphasizing the shift towards a new political landscape built on youth aspirations rather than appeasement politics. He contrasted his approach with that of his opponents, highlighting the potential for progress when focusing on national unity and development. 

Modi criticized past policies that prioritized pleasing specific religious groups, leading to the empowerment of fundamentalists and land grabbing. He cited the 2013 Waqf amendment as an example, arguing it benefited a select few at the expense of ordinary Muslims. 

In contrast, Modi emphasized his government's commitment to protecting the interests of all communities, including women, Pasmandas, and minorities, through recent amendments to the Waqf Act. He advocated for a "fast and fearless" approach to national progress, contrasting it with the "slow and steady" mantra of the past.">
