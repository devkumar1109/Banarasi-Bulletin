    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Mayawati Expels Nephew, Akash Anand, from BSP</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati expelled her nephew, Akash Anand, sending shockwaves through UP politics.  Party insiders cite Akash's "modern political approach" and criticism of BSP's functioning as reasons for his expulsion. His growing popularity is also seen as a contributing factor.  

Akash, once considered Mayawati's political heir, was appointed the party's national coordinator in 2019. He was included as a star campaigner for the 2022 Himachal Pradesh assembly elections, indicating his rising influence.  His modern style contrasted with the party's traditional approach.  
 
The final trigger was Akash's presence at a wedding event despite Mayawati's explicit orders. Experts believe this expulsion marks the end of Akash's political career within the BSP.">
