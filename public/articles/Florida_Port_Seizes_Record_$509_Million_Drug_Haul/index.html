    <meta name="description" content="Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel announced a $509 million drug seizure at a Florida port, marking one of the largest in the state's history. The operation targeted a major drug trafficking route, intercepting 45,000 pounds of cocaine, 3,800 pounds of marijuana, heroin, and fentanyl intended for US cities.  

The seizure involved collaboration between the military, the Department of Justice, and the US Coast Guard, utilizing drones, aircraft, and ships to apprehend traffickers near Peru, Ecuador, and the Galapagos Islands. Eleven prosecutions are expected in Florida's Middle District, demonstrating a commitment to holding those responsible accountable.
