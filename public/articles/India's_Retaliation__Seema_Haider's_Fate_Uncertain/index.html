    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - India's Retaliation:  Seema Haider's Fate Uncertain</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Following the Pahalgam terror attack, India has imposed strict measures against Pakistan, including expelling Pakistani defense officials, suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, and barring Pakistani citizens from the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme. These actions raise uncertainty about the future of Pakistani national Seema Haider, who entered India illegally to be with her Indian partner Sachin Meena after meeting through the online game PUBG.  

While Haider did not enter under the SVES, the government's hardline stance may lead to her expulsion. Haider, who has converted to Hinduism and claims to have married Sachin, faces unresolved legal issues and has not been granted Indian citizenship. 

Legal experts believe her case is complex, with the final decision likely depending on the Uttar Pradesh government's stance and any adverse reports filed.">
