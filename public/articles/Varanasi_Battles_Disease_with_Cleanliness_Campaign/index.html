UP ministers Ravindra Jaiswal and Dayashankar Mishra flagged off the campaign, urging residents to prevent waterlogging and maintain cleanliness. MLA Saurabh Srivastava highlighted the success in reducing disease cases compared to previous years, attributing it to inter-departmental coordination.

SVM Bhelupur Hospital introduced new facilities, including an ultrasound machine, digital X-ray, and outpatient services, to enhance medical care.
