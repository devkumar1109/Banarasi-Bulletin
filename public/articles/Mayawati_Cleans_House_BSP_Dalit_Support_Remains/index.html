    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Mayawati Cleans House, BSP Dalit Support Remains</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is facing internal turmoil with Mayawati expelling her nephew Akash Anand from the party.  Anand, who was previously removed and reinstated as national coordinator, is accused of disobeying Mayawati's instructions and siding with her brother-in-law, also expelled by the BSP. This pattern of removing potential rivals is not new for Mayawati, who has previously expelled prominent figures like Naseemuddin Siddiqui. Despite internal issues, the BSP enjoys strong support among Dalits, particularly Chamars, who view voting for the BSP as a debt of honour and gratitude for past benefits and implementation of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.">
