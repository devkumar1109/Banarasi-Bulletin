    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Cybercrime Trap: UP Youths Detained in Myanmar</title>
    <meta name="description" content="21 youths from Uttar Pradesh were deported from Myanmar after being tricked into participating in cybercrime operations. They were lured with promises of high-paying jobs in Thailand through Telegram by agents posing as recruiters. After passing a written test and a Delhi interview, they were given fake visas and transported to Myanmar where their passports were confiscated. 

In K K Park, a notorious cybercrime hub, they were forced to commit fraud via WhatsApp, VOIP calls, and social media, impersonating police officers and executing "digital arrest" scams. Those who resisted faced physical abuse, confinement, and threats. The gang demanded a $5,000 ransom if they refused to cooperate.

The youths were trained to create fake social media profiles and lure victims into fake investment schemes, ultimately scamming them of millions.  Many victims borrowed money or sold assets based on these fraudulent job opportunities.">
