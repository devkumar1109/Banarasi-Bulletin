    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi: Sewai For Eid, Unity In Flavors</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Varanasi, Hindu artisans have traditionally produced kimami sewai, a type of vermicelli, for Muslim Eid celebrations.  This practice reflects cultural integration in the holy city. 

The thin, premium kimami sewai is popular during Eid, while thicker, ghee-cooked soot-pheni is favored during Ramzan's sehri. Around 200 families in Varanasi engage in sewai production, employing 2,000 people.

Production peaks two to three months before Ramzan, with Banarasi sewai also exported to other countries.  The unique thinness of Banarasi sewai, made with refined flour and ghee, distinguishes it from other varieties.

While sales are good during other festivals like Holi and Bakrid, Eid sees the highest demand for this vermicelli.">
