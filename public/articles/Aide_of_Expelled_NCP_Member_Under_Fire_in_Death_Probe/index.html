    <meta name="description" content="Pune police searched the office and home of Nilesh Chavan, an aide to an expelled NCP member, in connection with the death of Vaishnavi Hagawane.  Chavan allegedly threatened Vaishnavi's father at gunpoint when he sought custody of his nine-month-old grandson. Police are investigating whether Vaishnavi's death was a suicide or murder. Chavan's laptop was seized and will be sent to the forensic science laboratory.  Pune police had issued firearms licenses to Chavan and his brothers for self-protection in 2022. A proposal has been submitted to cancel their licenses. The police commissionerate has also served a notice to Chavan's family seeking an explanation as to why his revolver license should not be revoked.">
