    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Trivedi: "One Nation, One Election" for Progress</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Rajya Sabha MP Sudhanshu Trivedi supports "One Nation, One Election" saying it aligns with the Constitution's original intent and promotes economic development and political stability. He argues that simultaneous elections will enable better coordination among chief ministers and the Prime Minister. 

Trivedi cites the 1952-1967 period of simultaneous elections as a successful example. He believes frequent elections cause instability, referencing the period from 1989 to 2014.  He highlights Prime Minister Modi's stable leadership since 2014 and the success of schemes like Jan Dhan Yojana.  

Trivedi asserts that the opposition's rejection of "One Nation, One Election" is aimed at hindering progress, but the Modi government is determined to implement it. He predicts positive outcomes such as improved administration, GDP savings, reduced inflation, and opportunities for cooperation with the opposition.">
