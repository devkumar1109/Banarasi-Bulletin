    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BHU Trauma Center: Doctors in Legal Fray</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Two FIRs have been lodged against doctors and staff at BHU's trauma center in Varanasi, exposing internal conflict. 

Dr. Manjari Mishra filed an FIR against Prof. Saurabh Singh (trauma center in-charge) and two bouncers on June 12.  This came after an FIR was lodged against her husband, Prof. Shashi Prakash Mishra, and Dr. Vishwambhar Singh on charges of assault, criminal intimidation, and violations under the SC-ST Act.  The latter case stems from a complaint by Kamlesh Kumar Gond, a waiter at the trauma center, alleging caste-based slurs and harassment by Prof. Mishra. Gond filed a complaint with the police in May 2023, which was followed by a court order in June 2025 for an FIR to be lodged.  Investigations are ongoing in both cases.  


 Former student leaders, who were protesting against corruption and other issues, have also been drawn into the conflict.">
