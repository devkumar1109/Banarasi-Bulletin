    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - PTR's Shell-Shocking Plan to Combat Turtle Trafficking</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) launched a long-term anti-trafficking plan for turtles on World Turtle Day.  

The initiative focuses on rehabilitating turtle traffickers by providing government-subsidized pisciculture schemes as an alternative livelihood. PTR, home to 13 freshwater turtle species, is a major trafficking zone in Uttar Pradesh.  

The plan includes setting up a turtle conservation and research center, funded by CAMPA. 

India, with 30 freshwater turtle species, experiences high demand for turtles in international markets for traditional medicine, meat, eggs, and blood. 

Operation Kurma by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) identified the Pilibhit-Kheri region as a sensitive turtle trafficking zone. 


Between 2009 and 2019, over 11,000 turtles were rescued annually from across India. Authorities are collaborating with various departments to strengthen enforcement and conservation efforts.">
