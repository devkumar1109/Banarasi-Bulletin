    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Congress Fights Back: Herald Case Sparks Political Battle</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Congress party is actively countering the BJP's narrative surrounding the ED chargesheet against Sonia and Rahul Gandhi in the National Herald case. Congress has deployed 57 spokespersons to hold press conferences across India, accusing the BJP of using the ED for "vendetta politics" and  labeling the case a "fabricated scam" to distract from economic failures.  Congress leaders argue that there is no financial transaction involved, thus eliminating money laundering charges and the ED's jurisdiction.  The BJP has dismissed these claims, calling them a "desperate attempt to deflect from corruption".  Analysts believe this strategy aims to regain narrative control ahead of state elections and challenge the BJP's media dominance.">
