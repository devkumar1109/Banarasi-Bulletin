    <meta name="description" content="Bihar is getting its first bullet train, a 260-kilometer elevated track as part of the Varanasi-Patna-Howrah High-Speed Rail Corridor. 

The National High-Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) is overseeing the project, with the Detailed Project Report expected to be finalized by August.  

The train will pass through Patna, Buxar, Ara, Jehanabad, and Gaya, reaching a top speed of 350 km/h. 

Construction is planned in two phases: connecting Varanasi to Howrah via key stations, followed by an extension from Delhi to Varanasi, creating a Delhi-Howrah high-speed network.  

The bullet train will utilize Japanese technology and offer amenities like automatic doors, CCTV security, and mobile charging points.">
