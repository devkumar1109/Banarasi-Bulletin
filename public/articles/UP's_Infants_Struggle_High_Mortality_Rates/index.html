    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP's Infants Struggle: High Mortality Rates</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh has the second highest child mortality rate in India, with 43 deaths per 1,000 births. The infant mortality rate (IMR) is 38 per 1,000 live births, and the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) is 28 per 1,000. These figures are higher than the national averages of 28 for IMR and 20 for NMR.  

A majority (63%) of child deaths occur in the neonatal stage, with 75% happening within the first week of life.  Unsafe deliveries are a major contributor, with infections like neonatal sepsis being a leading cause of newborn deaths.  

The government is addressing this through schemes like Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) and Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK), which promote institutional deliveries and provide free healthcare for newborns.  Newborn Care Corners (NBCCs) have also been established in delivery facilities to strengthen newborn care infrastructure.">
