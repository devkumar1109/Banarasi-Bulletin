    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Cyber Scam Victims Rescued from Southeast Asia</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Indian government brought back 549 Indian nationals from Southeast Asia who were victims of cybercrime scams.  The majority hailed from Uttar Pradesh (65), Maharashtra (61), Gujarat (57), and Punjab (48). The victims were lured with fake job offers for data entry operator positions with attractive salaries. However, upon arrival, they were forced into committing online fraud.

The CBI, NIA, and state police questioned the repatriated individuals. Investigations revealed a common pattern: placement agencies lured victims with fake job offers, and travel agents facilitated their travel to scam centers in Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos. Authorities are considering legal action against the placement agencies and travel agents involved in the deception.">
