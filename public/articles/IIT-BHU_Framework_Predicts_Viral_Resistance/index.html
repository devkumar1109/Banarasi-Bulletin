    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT-BHU Framework Predicts Viral Resistance</title>
    <meta name="description" content="IIT-BHU scientists developed a new computational framework to study viral evolution and drug resistance. The framework, published in the Biophysical Journal, uses protein design, machine learning, and multiscale simulations to analyze viral mutations. 

It can predict how viruses might resist treatments, focusing initially on SARS-CoV-2 and sotrovimab, but applicable to other diseases like cancer. The tool will be freely accessible to scientists and doctors globally, aiding the fight against drug resistance. This research supports India's national health programs aimed at pandemic preparedness.">
