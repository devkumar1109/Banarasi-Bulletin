    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT Madras Ignites Innovation at IInvenTiv 2023</title>
    <meta name="description" content="IIT Madras hosted the third edition of IInvenTiv, a research and development fair showcasing innovations from over 40 institutions. 

Highlights included:

* **Low-flying craft (WIG):** IIT Madras student Harish Rajesh demonstrated a WIG that can take off from water and fly 4 meters above sea level, potentially revolutionizing transportation. 
* **Portable weather station:** IIT (BHU) Varanasi presented a weather station providing localized microclimatic information to farmers, aiding in irrigation and pesticide use.
* **Fuel-efficient burners:** IIT Tirupati showcased porous radiant burners that can reduce fuel consumption and emissions by up to 50% in cooking.

Other innovations displayed ranged from drones and underwater vehicles to AI-based collision avoidance systems and cow-dung-based construction material. The event aimed to connect higher education institutions with industry and government to establish long-term goals.">
