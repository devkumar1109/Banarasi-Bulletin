    <meta name="description" content="Former Uttar Pradesh DGP O P Singh's new book, "Through My Eyes: Sketches from A Cop’s Notebook," recounts anecdotes from his 37-year career.  One story involves a caterer who fed former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh's entourage and was denied a Rs 7,000 bill due to the mention of "chicken" on the menu.  Another anecdote describes a home minister being forgotten at a railway station.  Singh, a 1983-batch IPS officer, retired in 2020 after heading the CISF and NDRF. His previous book, "Crime, Grime and Gumption," focused on case files from his time as an IPS officer.">
