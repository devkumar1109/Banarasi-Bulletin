    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Navratri Shutdown: Meat Shops Closed in Varanasi</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Varanasi Municipal Corporation (MC) has ordered the closure of all meat and fish shops within the city limits during Navratri, from March 30 to April 7. This decision was made to respect religious traditions and the sentiments of devotees observing the fast and worshipping Goddess Durga.  Around 400-500 meat and fish shops will be affected. Shop owners violating the order will face legal action.  

This decision comes after the MC issued notices in January to meat shop owners within a two-kilometer radius of the Vishwanath Temple, directing them to shut down. The MC claims no meat shops currently operate within this radius. However, shopkeepers allege harassment and lack of alternative arrangements.">
