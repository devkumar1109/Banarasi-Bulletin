    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Apna Dal Courts Jatav Vote for 2026 UP Polls</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Apna Dal (Soneylal) has appointed R P Gautam, a Jatav leader, as its state president in a bid to secure the Dalit vote in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. Gautam, currently the president of the Apna Dal's cooperative wing, is relatively unknown but the party plans to increase his visibility through public meetings. 

This move comes as the Samajwadi Party (SP) intensifies its Dalit outreach, inducting BSP leader Daddu Prasad and highlighting the issue after an MP's controversial remarks.  

The Apna Dal believes combining Jatav support with its existing Kurmi and Extremely Backward Classes (EBC) base will strengthen its position in the 2026 Assembly elections and 2025 local body elections.  The party cites the BSP’s success in the past, achieved through a similar social combination of Jatav and OBC leadership.">
