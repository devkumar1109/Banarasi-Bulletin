    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Religious Freedom, But No Coercion.</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Allahabad High Court ruled that the Indian Constitution protects the right to freely practice religion but does not allow forced or fraudulent conversions.  The court rejected a plea to dismiss an FIR against four individuals accused of attempting to convert people to Christianity by offering money and free medical care. 

The court emphasized that religious freedom is subject to public order, morality, and health, and that the Constitution does not condone coercive or deceptive practices.  The court also stated that the principle of secularism in India mandates equal respect for all religions, and the state cannot favor any particular faith.  The ruling upheld the validity of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Act, 2021, which aims to protect public order and moral integrity.">
