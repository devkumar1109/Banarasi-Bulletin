    <meta name="description" content="Punjab farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of migrant labourers for paddy transplantation, which is set to begin on June 1st in the first zone of Punjab. Thousands of migrants from states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Odisha typically arrive in Punjab for this crucial agricultural task. 

This year, farmers have experienced uncertainty due to potential delays. While some anticipate an increase in direct seeding of rice (DSR) due to fewer migrant arrivals, others believe labourers will arrive in the coming days. 

Many farmers have already made advance payments to secure workers, but the lack of confirmed bookings from labourers has caused concern. Paddy transplantation is scheduled to commence on different dates across Punjab, starting June 1st in some districts and progressing to June 9th in others.">
