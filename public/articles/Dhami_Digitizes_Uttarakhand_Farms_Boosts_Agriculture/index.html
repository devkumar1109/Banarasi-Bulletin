    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Dhami Digitizes Uttarakhand Farms, Boosts Agriculture</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami launched the 'e-Rupi' system, a digital payment initiative for farmers, enabling direct subsidy payments via e-vouchers.  

Dhami also unveiled four agricultural policies: the Kiwi Policy, Dragon Fruit Policy, Apple Post-Harvest Harvesting Scheme, and Millet Mission, aimed at boosting the state's agricultural sector.  The government plans to introduce a Flower and Honey Policy soon. 

The e-Rupi system will allow farmers to receive subsidies directly to their mobile phones via e-vouchers, which they can use to purchase essential agricultural supplies. The CM directed officials to conduct training programs in each village to educate farmers about the system.  


These initiatives aim to strengthen agriculture and employment in both hilly and plain areas, potentially reducing migration.">
