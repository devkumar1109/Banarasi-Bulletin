    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - "One Nation, One Election": Stability, Growth, and Progress</title>
    <meta name="description" content="BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi argues that "One Nation, One Election" aligns with the original intent of the Constitution and promotes stable governance. He cites the example of the 1952-1967 period with simultaneous elections and the instability caused by frequent elections between 1989 and 2014. Trivedi believes the system will foster long-term development plans, enhance administrative efficiency, and save 1% of GDP. He also asserts that opposition to the idea stems from a desire to hinder progress.  Trivedi emphasizes the success of the Modi government's Jan Dhan Yojana, which has empowered millions through direct benefit transfers.">
