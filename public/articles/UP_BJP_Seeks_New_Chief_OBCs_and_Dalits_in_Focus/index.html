    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP BJP Seeks New Chief, OBCs and Dalits in Focus</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The BJP is set to announce a new president for its Uttar Pradesh unit by early next week. The appointment process, initiated last October, was delayed due to internal discussions and political considerations.  

Union Home Minister Amit Shah's recent visit to Lucknow and a meeting with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath have finalized the decision.  Speculation points to Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Maurya as a potential candidate due to his OBC background and seniority.  

The BJP aims to choose either an OBC or Dalit leader to counter the growing influence of the Samajwadi Party and Congress, who gained support from these communities in the 2024 parliamentary polls. Other names in contention include Union Ministers B.L. Verma and Pankaj Chowdhary, and State Animal Husbandry Minister Dharampal Singh.">
