    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Ghaziabad-Kanpur Expressway: Faster, Greener Commute</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh will soon see the construction of a 380-km Ghaziabad-Kanpur Expressway, significantly reducing travel time from eight hours to 5 hours and 30 minutes.  

The expressway, developed under the Green Highway Policy, will connect nine districts: Ghaziabad, Hapur, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Kasganj, Farrukhabad, Kannauj, Unnao, and Kanpur. It will benefit thousands by improving connectivity, boosting economic growth, and creating job opportunities.  

The expressway is expected to be completed by 2026 and will initially have four lanes, with the possibility of expansion to six lanes in the future. It will connect with major highways like NH-9 and the Kanpur-Lucknow Expressway, and provide direct access to Noida’s Jewar Airport.">
