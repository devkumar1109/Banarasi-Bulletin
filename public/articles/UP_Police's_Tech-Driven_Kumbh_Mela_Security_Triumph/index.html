    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh Police successfully secured the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, which saw over 64 crore pilgrims.  

This achievement is credited to a modern, technology-driven approach to policing, including 2,700 AI-powered cameras, biometric tracking, and drone surveillance.

This model, which integrates intelligence agencies, local administrations, and emergency response teams, is considered a benchmark for security management, particularly in large-scale events.  

The UP Police also proactively addressed digital threats by establishing specialized cybercrime units and taking swift action against 140 social media accounts spreading misinformation during the Kumbh Mela.">
