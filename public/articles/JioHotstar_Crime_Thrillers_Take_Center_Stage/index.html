    <meta name="description" content="JioHotstar offers several compelling crime thrillers. 

"The Night Manager," an adaptation of the British series, stars Aditya Roy Kapur as a night manager entangled in the arms dealing world of Anil Kapoor's character. "Rudra: The Edge of Darkness," starring Ajay Devgn, is a psychological crime thriller based on "Luther" and follows a suspended DCP investigating Mumbai's most dangerous criminals. 

"Asur" blends forensic science with Indian mythology, featuring Barun Sobti and Arshad Warsi as they investigate gruesome murders linked to the asura Kali. "Saas, Bahu Aur Flamingo" reimagines the "saas-bahu" trope with a powerful drug cartel led by Dimple Kapadia, assisted by her daughters-in-law and daughter. "Kaala" stars Avinash Tiwary as a dedicated cop seeking justice in a corrupt system.">
