    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Modi's Vision: Beyond Appeasement, Towards New India</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the CNN-News18 Rising Bharat Summit 2025, outlining his vision for New India. He emphasized the need to move beyond 20th-century politics and focus on the aspirations of the youth, contrasting his approach with what he perceives as divisive politics of appeasement. 

Modi criticized past policies that he claims benefited only a select few and empowered fundamentalists at the expense of ordinary Muslims. He highlighted the 2013 Waqf amendment, which he believes was designed to appease Islamists, and the recent amendment passed in Parliament to protect waqf land and the interests of marginalized communities. 

While Modi stressed the importance of unity and inclusive development, he subtly criticized Rahul Gandhi's focus on caste census and minority politics.  He emphasized that inclusivity is not just a promise but a policy, and called for a "fast and fearless" approach to achieve India's goals by 2047.">
