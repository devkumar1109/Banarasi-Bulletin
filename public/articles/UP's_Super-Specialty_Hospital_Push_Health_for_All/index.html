    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP's Super-Specialty Hospital Push: Health for All</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh government is implementing a new health policy to establish 200-bed super-specialty hospitals in every district.  These hospitals will focus on treating heart, kidney, neurological, and cancer diseases.  The policy aims to attract private investment by offering incentives, particularly in rural areas.

The plan is divided into three models: Model A (17 municipalities) and Model B (57 district headquarters) will have 200-bed hospitals offering advanced medical facilities. Model C will establish 100-bed hospitals in all 75 districts, focusing on essential services.

Rural hospitals will receive additional support, including land purchase benefits, discounted land rates, and faster clearances. Investors in aspirational districts and the Bundelkhand region will receive up to 50% land concession.">
