    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - DMS Gas Hints at Life on Distant Exoplanet</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Nikku Madhusudhan, an astrophysicist and IIT-BHU alumnus, led a team that used the James Webb Space Telescope to find potential signs of life on exoplanet K2-18b, located 120 light years away.  

The team detected dimethyl sulphide (DMS), a gas produced by living organisms on Earth, in the exoplanet's atmosphere. While this doesn't confirm the existence of life, it suggests the possibility of biological processes.

K2-18b is a "hycean world," potentially covered by a warm ocean and a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, making it a suitable environment for life.  Madhusudhan emphasizes that the discovery is a significant step in the search for extraterrestrial life, demonstrating the ability to detect biosignatures on potentially habitable planets.">
