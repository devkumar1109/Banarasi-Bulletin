    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - ESIC Expands Coverage in UP, Nearing Universal Access</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) has expanded its coverage to 15 more districts in Uttar Pradesh, bringing the total number of covered districts to 74 out of 75.  The expansion will benefit 30.08 lakh Insured Persons (IPs) and 1.16 crore beneficiaries, providing them with enhanced healthcare and social security services. This move aligns with the government's goal of achieving universal social security coverage. Nationwide, the ESI Scheme covers 689 districts, with 586 fully notified and 103 partially notified.  The government is actively working to extend coverage to the remaining 89 uncovered districts through collaborations with state governments, utilization of Community Health Centers and Primary Health Centers, and integration with the Ayushman Bharat PMJAY scheme.">
