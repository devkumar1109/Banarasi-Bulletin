    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BJP Accuses SP of Dalit Oppression, Citing Casteism</title>
    <meta name="description" content="BJP state general secretary Dharampal Singh accused the Samajwadi Party government under Akhilesh Yadav of oppressing Dalits and filing false cases against them. 

Singh claimed that the SP government engaged in Muslim appeasement, state-protected crime, corruption, and casteism, leading to the most oppression of SCs.  He further alleged that the SP and Congress aim to create caste-based conflicts to weaken the country for political gain. 

In contrast, Singh highlighted the BJP's commitment to the economic, social, and political upliftment of SC/ST communities, emphasizing their representation in high positions and the strengthening of constitutional rights, including reservations. He cited Prime Minister Modi's initiatives as examples of upholding Ambedkar's principles.">
