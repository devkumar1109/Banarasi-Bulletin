    <meta name="description" content="The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABHA) is streamlining healthcare in Varanasi by creating digital health IDs for citizens, similar to bank accounts.  These ABHA cards store medical records and prescriptions, allowing patients to access their information digitally.  Over 30.5 lakh ABHA IDs have been generated in the district, with 1,378 healthcare providers registered.  Patients can use their ABHA IDs to obtain OPD slips without queuing and connect with government health programs.  ABHA also enables doctors and hospitals to access patient records digitally, including lab reports, prescriptions, and admission/discharge details.  Family members can be added to a single ABHA account, and patients can scan a QR code at ABHA counters using their phone app to obtain OPD slips.">
