    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT-BHU's Nano-Sensor: Ultra-Sensitive Drug Detection</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Researchers at IIT-BHU have developed a 3D trimetallic nanodendrite-based electrochemical sensing device for highly sensitive drug detection. The device can detect even trace amounts of drugs in pharmaceutical formulations and milk samples.  

IIT-BHU holds the patent for this technology, with Prof Pranjal Chandra, Rohini Kumari, and Daphika S Dkhar as inventors.  

The new sensor offers several advantages, including excellent stability, fast response time, and a single-step modification process. It's designed to overcome limitations of existing methods by simplifying preparation, reducing detection time, and achieving lower detection limits.  

The technology was validated in various real sample matrices, including milk samples and drug formulations. This device can be used to detect drug overdoses or adulteration in food samples.">
