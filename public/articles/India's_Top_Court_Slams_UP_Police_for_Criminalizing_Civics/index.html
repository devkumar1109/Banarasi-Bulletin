    <meta name="description" content="The Supreme Court of India criticized the Uttar Pradesh Police for repeatedly converting civil suits into criminal cases, calling it a "complete breakdown of rule of law."  

The court specifically addressed a case involving a money dispute where the police filed a chargesheet seeking to criminalize a civil matter. Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna found this practice "absurd," stating that "merely not giving money cannot be turned into an offense." 

The court stayed the criminal prosecution in the case and directed the investigating officer to appear in court and justify the charges. It also warned the Uttar Pradesh Police that further such instances would result in financial penalties. This isn't the first time the CJI has expressed concern over this trend, highlighting the unnecessary burden it places on the criminal justice system.">
