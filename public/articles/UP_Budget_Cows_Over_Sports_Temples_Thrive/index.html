    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Budget: Cows Over Sports, Temples Thrive</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh's 2025-26 budget allocated Rs 2,000 crore for "gauvansh" (stray cows and bulls), five times the allocation for sports development (Rs 400 crore).  

The budget highlights a focus on temple tourism and cattle welfare. Rs 140 crore was earmarked for cow protection centers, and Rs 123 crore for veterinary hospitals. Notably, the budget specifically uses "gauvansh" instead of "livestock," leaving the fate of other animals unclear.

The allocation for stray cows translates to Rs 20,000 per animal annually, exceeding the central government's Rs 6,000 annual grant for farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana.">
