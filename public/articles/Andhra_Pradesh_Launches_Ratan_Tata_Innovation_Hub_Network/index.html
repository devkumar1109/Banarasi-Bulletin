    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Andhra Pradesh Launches Ratan Tata Innovation Hub Network</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Andhra Pradesh government has issued guidelines for establishing the Ratan Tata Innovation Hub (RTIH). The central hub will be located in Amaravati, with five spokes in Visakhapatnam, Rajahmundry, NTR, Tirupati, and Anantapur. 

The RTIH will be privately funded and managed, with partial seed capital and grants provided by the government through the Andhra Pradesh Innovation Society (APIS). 

Each hub and spoke will have a board of governors overseeing strategy, governance, investment facilitation, incubation, and stakeholder management. 

The APIS CEO will evaluate applications from potential promoters, and the government will approve the incorporation of the hub and spokes. District collectors have been tasked with finding suitable buildings for the spokes and a 5-acre plot for the permanent RTIH building in Amaravati.">
