    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Scorching India: Heatwave Grips Nation, Exacerbating Poverty</title>
    <meta name="description" content="India experienced unprecedented heat from March to June 2024, with 37 cities seeing temperatures exceeding 45 degrees Celsius. May 2024 was particularly severe, with temperatures averaging 31.7C, a degree higher than May 2023.  Electricity demand surged 6.1% from April to September 2024 compared to the previous year, with air conditioning accounting for an estimated 30% of the increase.  

The heat disproportionately impacts the poor. Some, like Subhash Tiwari, were able to borrow money for air conditioners, while others, like Dimple Mishra, couldn't even afford a cooler.  Rising electricity costs are forcing families into difficult situations, with some considering sending children to work.  State-run healthcare facilities are overwhelmed, struggling to cope with the influx of heat-related illnesses.">
