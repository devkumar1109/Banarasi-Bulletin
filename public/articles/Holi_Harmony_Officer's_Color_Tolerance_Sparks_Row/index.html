    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Holi Harmony: Officer's "Color Tolerance" Sparks Row</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A UP police officer sparked controversy by stating that only those who can "tolerate color" should step out on Holi, as it falls on the same day as Friday prayers. The officer's comments, made during a peace committee meeting, imply that individuals should accept being smeared with color even if unwilling.  

The Uttar Pradesh Government Servants Conduct Rules, 1956, and the Ministry of Home Affairs’ Model Code of Conduct for Indian Police explicitly require government employees and officers to treat all citizens equally and promote harmony, regardless of religion. 

Former UP DGPs Sukhkan Singh and Vikram Singh criticized the officer's statements, emphasizing the police's duty to ensure no one is forcefully colored and to refrain from revealing personal biases. 

UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath defended the officer,  comparing the frequency of Holi and Friday prayers and suggesting individuals can pray at home if they don't want to be exposed to Holi festivities. 


This comparison, however, contradicts Islamic teachings, as Friday prayers are obligatory in congregation at a mosque.">
