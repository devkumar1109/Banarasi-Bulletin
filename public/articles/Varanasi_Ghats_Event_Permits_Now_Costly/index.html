    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Ghats: Event Permits Now Costly</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Varanasi civic body will now charge a fee for organizing events on the ghats of the Ganga river. 

Organizers will have to pay ₹880 per square meter for permission, which must be applied for at least 15 days in advance through the Smart Kashi app. 

Previously, organizers only needed permission from the civic body, without any associated fees.  Applications require photographs of the event location and detailed event information, which will be reviewed by a zonal officer. 
 This new system is expected to be implemented within a few days.">
