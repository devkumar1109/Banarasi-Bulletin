Under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's leadership, a zero-tolerance policy has led to the neutralization of 230 criminals, including the dismantling of 142 sleeper cells and 11 funding networks.  

The state's Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) has been instrumental in these efforts, targeting both global and domestic terror groups.  The crackdown has also resulted in the seizure of fake currency, disrupting terrorist financial channels.  Uttar Pradesh is striving to become a crime-free state.">
