    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Pollachi Rape Case: Justice Served, System Tested</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Pollachi gang rape case highlighted procedural lapses and flaws in handling crimes against women.  Initial investigation was mishandled, including public disclosure of a survivor's identity and downplaying the crime's scope.  

After public outcry and political pressure, the case was transferred to the CB-CID, then to the CBI.  

CB-CID SP Nisha Parthiban identified more survivors and secured their cooperation, revealing the scale of the crime. However, criticism arose when the accused were allowed to meet family members during transit.  

Ultimately, the CBI built a strong case, leading to a trial before Coimbatore District Mahila Court judge R Nandhini Devi. The judge's sensitivity and protection measures ensured survivor and witness testimonies remained strong, culminating in the conviction of all perpetrators.">
