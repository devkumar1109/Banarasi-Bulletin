    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BJP Blasts Opposition Over Maha Kumbh Tragedy</title>
    <meta name="description" content="BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi accused the opposition of seeking political gain from the Maha Kumbh tragedy, citing Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav's questioning of the death toll. Trivedi criticized Yadav for raising doubts on various issues, including the COVID-19 vaccines and the Ram Lalla consecration, and labeled remarks like "Mrityu Kumbh" as politically motivated. He praised the successful organization of the Maha Kumbh, attributing it to PM Modi's policies that have boosted tourism in UP. Trivedi also criticized the opposition for opposing India's efforts to tackle illegal immigration, particularly by the US, claiming they view such immigrants as a vote bank.  He contrasted this with the Congress regime, where genuine visitors faced frisking, highlighting the BJP's strong stance on the issue.">
