    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BJP Blasts Opposition Over Maha Kumbh Tragedy</title>
    <meta name="description" content="BJP spokesman Sudhanshu Trivedi accused the opposition of seeking political gain from the Maha Kumbh tragedy, particularly targeting Akhilesh Yadav for questioning the death toll. Trivedi criticized Yadav for previous instances like doubting Covid-19 vaccines and the 'Muhurt' of the Ram Lalla consecration. He also condemned opposition remarks like 'Mrityu Kumbh,' alleging they are the same parties seeking to eradicate Sanatan and dismantle Hinduism globally. 

Trivedi praised the successful organization of Maha Kumbh, highlighting its economic and cultural impact. He lauded PM Modi's policies for transforming tourism, citing the increased footfall at Kashi Vishwanath Dham and Ram Mandir.  Trivedi also criticized the opposition's stance on the deportation of illegal Indian immigrants by the US, accusing them of opposing India's efforts to tackle illegal immigration and seeing Bangladeshi immigrants as a vote bank. He contrasted this with the Congress's handling of immigration, citing instances where dignitaries and celebrities were frisked disrespectfully.">
