    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IAS Officer Suspended for Alleged Solar Bribe</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Abhishek Prakash, a 2006 batch IAS officer and IIT Roorkee alumnus, has been suspended by the Uttar Pradesh government for allegedly demanding a commission for approving a solar project.  

The complaint, filed by Vishwajeet Dutt, alleges Prakash's office directed him to contact Nikant Jain, who demanded a 5% commission and an advance payment. This action comes under CM Yogi Adityanath's stringent anti-corruption drive.  

Prakash, born in 1982, previously served as District Magistrate in several districts including Lucknow, Lakhimpur Kheri, Aligarh, and Hamirpur. He also held the positions of Secretary, Industrial Development Department, and CEO of Invest UP.">
