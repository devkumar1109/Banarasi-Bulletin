    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Stalin Slams Adityanath's NEP, Delimitation Barbs</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin criticized Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for his comments on Tamil Nadu's protests against the National Education Policy (NEP) and Lok Sabha delimitation. Stalin called Adityanath's criticism "political black comedy at its darkest" and said the BJP is rattled by the widespread protests. 

Stalin emphasized that Tamil Nadu is not opposed to any language but rather the imposition and chauvinism associated with them. He framed the protests as a "battle for dignity and justice" against what he perceives as BJP's attempt to divide the country along regional and linguistic lines.
