    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - U.P. Assembly Bans Gutkha After Paan Masala Stain</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In a recent floor test, the Uttar Pradesh Assembly banned chewing gutkha inside its premises following an incident where an MLA spat paan masala on the Assembly carpet. Assembly Speaker Satish Mahana, who personally oversaw the cleaning, threatened to recover the cleaning costs from the legislator, but ultimately resolved the matter privately.  Mahana emphasized the need for legislators to change their habits and behave like first-world citizens.  This incident is not the first spit row to taint the Uttar Pradesh Assembly.  In 2022, Opposition leader Akhilesh Yadav tweeted a video of a BJP MLA chewing tobacco, while in February 2023, the West Bengal Assembly proposed a bill imposing heavy fines for spitting tobacco in public places.">
