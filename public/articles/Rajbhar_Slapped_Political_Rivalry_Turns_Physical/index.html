    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Rajbhar Slapped: Political Rivalry Turns Physical</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Suheldev Swabhiman Party (SSP) president Mahendra Rajbhar was slapped by a party worker at an event in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh. Rajbhar alleges that the attack was orchestrated by Uttar Pradesh Minister and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar to damage his political image.  

Rajbhar claims the incident was planned due to jealousy over the SSP's growing popularity and support base. He filed a police complaint and asserts that such attacks won't deter his political journey. Rajbhar previously left the SBSP citing dissatisfaction with the seat-sharing arrangement in the last elections.">
