    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - India's AI Ambitions: Powering the Future with Nuclear</title>
    <meta name="description" content="India is strategically investing in AI development, aiming to build a complete AI stack from semiconductors to foundational models.

India plans to invest in domestic semiconductor fabrication to strengthen national security and diversify supply chains. The nation also aims to develop cost-effective, contextually relevant large language models (LLMs).  

The 2025-2026 Union Budget allocated Rs 20,000 crore for research and development of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), with the goal of increasing India's nuclear capacity to 100 GW by 2047. This is driven by the need for reliable and cost-effective energy to power AI's computational demands.  
 
India sees nuclear energy as a key enabler for its AI ambitions, aligning with the global resurgence of interest in nuclear power.">
