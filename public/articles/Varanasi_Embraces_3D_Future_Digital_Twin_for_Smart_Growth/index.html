    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Embraces 3D Future: Digital Twin for Smart Growth</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Varanasi is the first city in India to utilize a large-scale 3D model for urban planning and development. This 3D Urban Spatial Digital Twin, costing Rs six crore, took nine months to complete and covers a 160 sq km area.  

The model, created using LiDAR, 360-degree imagery, and 3D modeling, provides a detailed representation of the city, including its alleys, the Ganga river, temples, and key locations. 

This technology will enable sustainable development, flood level prediction, precise measurements for planning projects, real-time crowd and traffic management, and improved waste and water management.">
