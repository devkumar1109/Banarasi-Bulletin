    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Moringa:  Greener Hospitals, Healthier India</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Varanasi health department is planting moringa trees on the grounds of government hospitals to improve the environment and provide health benefits. Moringa is a nutrient-rich tree with leaves, pods, and seeds packed with vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals. 

The department aims to plant two moringa trees at each community health center, primary health center, and health sub-center. This initiative is particularly beneficial as the National Family Health Survey indicates that 32% of children in India are underweight, and moringa can help combat malnutrition and anemia.  

The health department is also emphasizing the importance of reducing plastic use to protect the environment.">
