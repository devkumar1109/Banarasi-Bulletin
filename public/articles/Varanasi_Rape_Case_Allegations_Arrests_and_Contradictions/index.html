    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Rape Case: Allegations, Arrests, and Contradictions</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A 19-year-old woman in Varanasi filed a complaint alleging she was raped by 23 people between March 29 and April 4. 14 of the 23 accused have been arrested, while the remaining arrests are pending a Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe.  

Families of some accused claim the woman demanded money to remove names from the complaint and question why she didn't seek help during the alleged assaults, citing her social media activity. They also allege inconsistencies in her testimony, claiming she initially named 23 people but identified only nine in court. 

Police Commissioner Mohit Agarwal confirmed the survivor initially didn't mention rape or a desire to return home.  The SIT will examine both the survivor's allegations and the counterclaims from the accused's families.">
