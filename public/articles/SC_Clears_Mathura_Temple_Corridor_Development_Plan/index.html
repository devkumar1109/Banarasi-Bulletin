    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - SC Clears Mathura Temple Corridor Development Plan</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Supreme Court has approved the Uttar Pradesh government's plan to develop the Shri Banke Bihari Temple corridor in Mathura.  The court permitted the government to use temple funds to purchase 5 acres of land for parking, accommodation, toilets, security check posts, and other amenities. This decision overturns the Allahabad High Court's November 2023 order, which had blocked the use of temple funds for land acquisition.  The court emphasized the need for the development project to ensure the safety of pilgrims, citing the temple's limited space and the lack of adequate facilities.  The Uttar Pradesh government estimates the corridor development project will cost over Rs 500 crore.">
