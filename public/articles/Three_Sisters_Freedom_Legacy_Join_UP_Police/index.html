They were inspired by social media portrayals of the police profession and a desire to serve the nation.

The UPPRPB selected 60,244 candidates from nearly 48 lakh applications for 60,244 constable positions. The selection process included a written exam, document verification, physical efficiency test, and medical examination. The sisters' selection was under the 'dependent of freedom fighter' quota.">
