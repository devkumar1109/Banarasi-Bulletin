    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Cauvery Aarti: Politics, Religion, and Water Crisis</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Karnataka's Congress government organized a grand Cauvery 'Aarti' ceremony at Bengaluru's Sankey Tank, drawing parallels to Varanasi's Ganga Aarti.  The event, described by officials as a cultural tribute to the river, has sparked debate about political motivations and religious symbolism. 

Critics view it as an attempt by the Congress to counter accusations of minority appeasement and appeal to Hindu voters, particularly amidst controversies over the 4% Muslim quota bill. Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar, a key figure in the event, has recently engaged in high-profile Hindu religious activities, leading to speculation about his political strategy. 

The ceremony faced legal scrutiny due to environmental concerns, with the Karnataka High Court directing authorities to follow legal provisions governing water body activities.  The event has also drawn criticism for its timing, coinciding with a severe water crisis affecting Bengaluru's lakes and an ongoing interstate dispute with Tamil Nadu over Cauvery water.">
