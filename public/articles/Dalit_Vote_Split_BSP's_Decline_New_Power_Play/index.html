    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Dalit Vote Split: BSP's Decline, New Power Play</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Dalit politics in Uttar Pradesh is in flux following the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)'s decline. The BSP's vote share has plummeted from over 30% in 2007 to 9.3% in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.  

This decline has created a power vacuum, with Dalit votes now divided among four major players: the BSP, BJP, Samajwadi Party (SP), and Chandrashekhar Azad's Aazad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram).

The BJP has been gaining non-Jatav Dalit votes since 2014, while the SP-Congress alliance secured a significant share of Dalit votes in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.  

Internal power struggles within the BSP, including the expulsion of Mayawati's nephew and other senior leaders joining rival parties, have further weakened the BSP's hold on its traditional base.">
