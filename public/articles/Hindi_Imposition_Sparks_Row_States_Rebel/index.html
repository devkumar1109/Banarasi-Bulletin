    <meta name="description" content="Debates over Hindi imposition have intensified, with Tamil Nadu, Bengal, and Punjab resisting. Tamil Nadu's DMK government opposes the NEP 2020's three-language formula, viewing it as an attempt to impose Hindi.  They refuse to implement the policy, leading to the central government withholding funds.  Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan argues the NEP promotes Indian languages, but Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin sees it as an attack on federalism and linguistic diversity. 

This conflict echoes historical resistance to Hindi imposition, with violent protests in 1937 and 1965 forcing policy rollbacks. Critics argue the NEP disproportionately pushes Hindi, neglecting non-Hindi languages in North India. The language debate has strong political undertones, as the Hindi-speaking belt holds significant parliamentary seats, forming a BJP stronghold.">
