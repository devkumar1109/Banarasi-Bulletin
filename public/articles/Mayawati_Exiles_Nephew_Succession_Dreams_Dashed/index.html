    <meta name="description" content="BSP supremo Mayawati expelled her nephew Akash Anand on March 3, 2025, after stripping him of all responsibilities.  The move, attributed to accusations of Akash's "selfishness" and undue influence from his father-in-law, highlights Mayawati's tight control over the party. Akash, previously considered Mayawati's political successor, was seen as a way to connect with a younger Dalit electorate. His expulsion ends any hope of succession, as Mayawati has stated there will be no heir while she lives. This decision, coupled with the BSP's dwindling relevance, raises concerns about the party's future.">
