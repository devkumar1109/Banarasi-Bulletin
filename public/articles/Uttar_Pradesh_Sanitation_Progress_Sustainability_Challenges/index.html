    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Uttar Pradesh: Sanitation Progress, Sustainability Challenges</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh has made significant progress in faecal sludge management, increasing the number of treatment plants from one in 2018 to 59 by the end of 2024. However, sustaining this progress requires robust operational and financial systems. 

A CSE study found three main management models: ULB-run plants, SHG-managed plants, and privately contracted plants. While ULB-managed plants are cost-effective, they often face low utilisation due to limited desludging services. SHG-managed plants promote community participation but struggle with underutilisation and salary delays. Private contractors offer operational efficiency but raise concerns about cost and transparency. 


The study recommends improvements in each model to ensure sustainable and scalable sanitation systems in Uttar Pradesh and beyond.">
