    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - India's Cities Swelter: Warm Nights on the Rise</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A new study by CEEW reveals a concerning increase in "very warm nights" across India. Over the past decade, 70% of districts experienced more than five additional "very warm nights" each summer, with the most significant increase seen in densely populated cities due to the urban heat island effect. 

These "very warm nights," where temperatures exceed 6.4℃ above normal, prevent the body from cooling down after intense daytime heat, increasing the risk of heat stroke and exacerbating chronic health conditions. Vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, pregnant women, laborers, and marginalized communities, are disproportionately affected.

The study highlights the urgent need to revise city-level Heat Action Plans and invest in sustainable cooling solutions to mitigate the risks of prolonged and intense heat.">
