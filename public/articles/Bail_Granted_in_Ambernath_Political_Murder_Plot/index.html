    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Bail Granted in Ambernath Political Murder Plot</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Thane Sessions Court granted bail to Kiran Ashok Gaikwad and Dipesh alias Deepak Tulshiram Jadhav in an attempt to murder case linked to political rivalry in Ambernath.  The court ruled that the fact some accused are absconding doesn't justify denying bail to arrested individuals. 

The case stems from a November 2022 FIR filed by Shiv Sena member Rahul Pandit Patil, alleging a conspiracy by political rivals to eliminate him.  The incident involved an ambush near Sudama Hotel, MIDC, where Patil and his associates were allegedly attacked with guns, pistols, and stones. 

Gaikwad and Jadhav were arrested in January 2024 after being absconding for several months. A supplementary chargesheet was filed against them. While the prosecution opposed bail citing the seriousness of the offence and alleged confession by Gaikwad, the defense argued for parity with other co-accused who had already been granted bail.">
