    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Liking Not Publishing: HC Rules on Social Media Liability</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Allahabad High Court (HC) ruled that "liking" a social media post does not constitute publishing or transmitting it. This decision comes in a case where Imran Khan was charged under Section 67 of the IT Act for liking a post related to unlawful assembly. 

The court, citing a 2023 judgment, stated that liking a post is distinct from posting it. It also clarified that Section 67 of the IT Act deals with "obscene materials," not provocative content, and that "publishing" under this section refers to posting content, while "transmission" means sharing or re-tweeting.  

This decision has implications for free speech, digital privacy, and platform liability in India.">
