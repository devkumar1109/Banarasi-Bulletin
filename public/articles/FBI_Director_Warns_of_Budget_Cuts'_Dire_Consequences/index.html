    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - FBI Director Warns of Budget Cuts' Dire Consequences</title>
    <meta name="description" content="FBI Director Kash Patel is criticizing President Trump's proposed $545 million budget cut for the FBI. Patel argues that the cut would severely harm core FBI operations and necessitate difficult staffing and resource decisions. He insists the FBI needs $11.1 billion to operate without layoffs.  

The proposed budget prioritizes counterterrorism and fieldwork, reduces D.C. overhead, and cuts diversity programs. Patel is negotiating with Congress to reverse the cut and secure the requested $11.2 billion. 

The budget proposal also includes a move of 904 positions from Washington, D.C., to field offices to improve crime management, but concerns remain about its potential impact on intelligence capabilities.">
