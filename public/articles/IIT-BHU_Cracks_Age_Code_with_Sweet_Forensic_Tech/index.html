    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT-BHU Cracks Age Code with Sweet Forensic Tech</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A research team from IIT-BHU, Varanasi won the Forensic Hackathon 2025 for developing a glycan-based forensic technology to accurately estimate age using biological fluids. This method, led by Prof. Sumit Kumar Singh, uses glycomic profiling and machine learning to decode molecular signatures, offering insights into an individual's age, health, and physiological condition.  

The technology addresses limitations of DNA-based age estimation, which can be inaccurate with degraded samples or diverse populations. Glycans, complex sugar molecules, change systematically with age, making them useful for forensic investigations. This innovation has the potential to transform forensic investigations in India.">
