    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Senate averts shutdown, Trump wins spending boost</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The U.S. Senate narrowly passed a Republican-led funding bill with a 54-46 vote, averting a government shutdown. The bill grants President Donald Trump increased control over federal spending by reducing non-defense funds while boosting military spending.  

Democrats supported the bill to prevent a shutdown but criticized it for giving Trump excessive power, calling it a "blank cheque." While Democrats acknowledged the need to avoid harm to the American people, they urged Republicans to prioritize the nation's broader needs in future spending negotiations. The vote highlights the ongoing political tension over budget priorities and the difficulties in reaching bipartisan agreements on federal spending.">
