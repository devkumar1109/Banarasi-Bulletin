    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Temple Row: BJP's "Indirect Control" Sparks Debate</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The UP Department of Religious Affairs is in the spotlight after the Yogi Adityanath government constituted a trust to manage the Banke Bihari temple, part of a plan to redevelop the Banke Bihari corridor. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav criticized the move, accusing the BJP of "indirectly taking control" of temples. The department, revived by Akhilesh Yadav during his tenure as CM, has gained prominence under Adityanath, especially after its tie-up with the Tourism Department to promote religious tourism. 

Adityanath established the "Braj Teerth Vikas Parishad" in 2018 to develop temples and pilgrimage sites in the region, followed by six more such parishads.  While other parishads remain inactive, the Braj Teerth Vikas Parishad is fully operational.  Assistance for pilgrims undertaking the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra and Sindhu Darshan Yatra was also increased under Adityanath's regime.">
