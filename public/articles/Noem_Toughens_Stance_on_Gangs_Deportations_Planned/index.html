    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Noem Toughens Stance on Gangs, Deportations Planned</title>
    <meta name="description" content="U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited a high-security prison in El Salvador housing Venezuelans linked to the Tren de Aragua gang. The visit aims to strengthen U.S.-El Salvador ties and deter illegal immigration. Noem recorded a warning to potential offenders, stating they will be removed and prosecuted.  The prison, known for its harsh conditions, is part of El Salvador's gang crackdown under President Nayib Bukele. Noem emphasized the U.S. commitment to the partnership, with more deportations planned and stricter consequences for criminals. The visit, while seen as a bold crime-fighting move, also raises questions about its political motivations. Noem will continue her mission in Colombia and Mexico.">
