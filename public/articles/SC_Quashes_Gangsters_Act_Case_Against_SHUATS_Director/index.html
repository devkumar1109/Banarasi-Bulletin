    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - SC Quashes Gangsters Act Case Against SHUATS Director</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Supreme Court has quashed criminal proceedings against Vinod Bihari Lal, Director of Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture Technology and Science (SHUATS), after finding that the Uttar Pradesh Police's invocation of the Gangsters Act was unwarranted. The court observed that the FIR and chargesheet lacked independent application of mind and that continuing the case would amount to undue harassment and abuse of process.  The decision reverses the Allahabad High Court's April 2023 order, which had refused to quash the FIR against Lal.">
