    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Karni Sena Attacks MP Suman, SP Alleges BJP Intimidation</title>
    <meta name="description" content="On April 27, Karni Sena members attacked Samajwadi Party MP Ramji Lal Suman's convoy in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, hurling stones and tires.  No injuries were reported, and MP Suman was safely escorted.  The Aligarh police registered a case and suspended a sub-inspector and a constable for dereliction of duty.  SP chief Akhilesh Yadav condemned the attack, alleging it was part of a wider pattern of intimidation against Dalits, Backward Castes, and minorities by the BJP government. Yadav claimed the attack had the backing of state officials, including the DGP. He cited other alleged incidents of violence against PDA communities in various parts of Uttar Pradesh. Karni Sena state president Gyanendra Singh Chauhan claimed responsibility for the attack, stating they had warned against Suman's entry into the district.">
