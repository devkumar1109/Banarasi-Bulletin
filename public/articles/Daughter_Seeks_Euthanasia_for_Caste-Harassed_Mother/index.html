    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Daughter Seeks Euthanasia for Caste-Harassed Mother</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Neha Shah, daughter of former deputy jailor Meena Kanojia, has written to President Droupadi Murmu requesting euthanasia. Shah alleges that her mother, a Scheduled Caste officer, faced months of harassment from Varanasi District Jail Superintendent Umesh Kumar Singh, including caste-based slurs, humiliation, and threats. 

Despite multiple complaints, including allegations of Singh forcing a woman to undress in a jail office captured in explicit videos, Shah claims no action has been taken.  She fears her mother will be suspended for speaking out and believes Singh will destroy their family. 
Shah accuses Singh of making obscene gestures, pressuring her mother to visit his home and office, and coercing her to lure female inmates. She also alleges Singh has a history of misconduct with another former deputy jailor.">
