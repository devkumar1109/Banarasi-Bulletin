    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Ambernath Bail: Court Releases Accused in Political Hit Attempt</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Thane Sessions Court granted bail to Kiran Ashok Gaikwad and Dipesh alias Deepak Tulshiram Jadhav, accused in an attempt to murder case linked to political rivalry in Ambernath.  

The court ruled that the presence of absconding accused doesn't warrant denying bail to those arrested. The case stems from an FIR filed by Rahul Pandit Patil, a Shiv Sena member, who alleged a conspiracy to eliminate him by political rivals led by Kunal Patil. 

Patil was attacked near Sudama Hotel, MIDC, in November 2022, prompting an attempt to murder case. The MCOCA Act was invoked as the investigation revealed the accused's alleged involvement in an organized crime syndicate. Gaikwad and Jadhav, arrested in January 2024, maintained their innocence despite Gaikwad's initial confession under MCOC Act, which he later retracted.">
