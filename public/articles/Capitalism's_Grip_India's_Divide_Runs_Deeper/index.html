    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Capitalism's Grip: India's Divide Runs Deeper.</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The article argues that the north-south divide in India is a distraction from the real issue: corporate capitalism. 

While southern states have seen more progress than "BIMARU" states in the north, significant inequality persists within the south itself.  Economist Rathin Roy points out that some districts in southern states lag behind even the poorest districts in Uttar Pradesh.

The article suggests that this underdevelopment is a product of a capitalist system that relies on exploiting cheap resources and labor.  It argues that both north and south are impacted by this system, with the "developed south" benefiting from colonial and post-colonial capitalist patronage.  

The article criticizes the Modi government for policies that exacerbate regional inequality, including delimitation exercises and attempts to impose Hindi and Sanskrit.  It concludes that addressing the structural problems of capitalism is crucial for solving India's regional and social inequalities.">
