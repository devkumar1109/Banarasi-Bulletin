    <meta name="description" content="Here is a summary of the news article in 150 words:

India's first biopolymer manufacturing plant is being set up in Uttar Pradesh with an investment of Rs 2,850 crore by Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd (BCML). The plant will produce eco-friendly alternatives to single-use plastics, specifically Polylactic Acid (PLA), from raw materials like sugar, corn, and tapioca. The integrated polymer plant will run on renewable energy, supporting India's net zero emissions target. The biodegradable products to be manufactured include cups, plates, cutlery, and straws, addressing environmental concerns caused by plastic waste. With a current global PLA production of 21 lakh tonnes, India has an opportunity to capture the market share. The plant is expected to commence operations by December 2026 with an initial capacity of 80,000 tonnes. The company has collaborated with Alpine from Austria and Sulzer from Switzerland for technology transfer. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath laid the foundation stone for the biopolymer plant in Kumbhi, Lakhimpur Kheri district.">
