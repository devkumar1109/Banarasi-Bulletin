    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Duraimurugan's Ramayana Remark Ignites Assembly Row</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Tamil Nadu water resources minister Duraimurugan sparked controversy in the assembly by stating that women were abducted even in the Ramayana.  His remark came during a discussion about crimes against women in the state,  initiated by BJP MLA Vanathi Srinivasan who expressed concern over rising crimes against women in Tamil Nadu. 

Law minister S Regupathy countered that crime against women in Tamil Nadu is lower compared to north Indian states, while Duraimurugan cited a recent rape incident in Varanasi, PM Narendra Modi's constituency, to emphasize the presence of evil forces everywhere.  

Vanathi insisted that Tamil Nadu should be compared to developed nations like Scandinavian countries due to its historical and traditional growth rate. CM M K Stalin responded by suggesting Vanathi approach her party high command to secure pending funds for Tamil Nadu if it aspires for developed nation status.">
