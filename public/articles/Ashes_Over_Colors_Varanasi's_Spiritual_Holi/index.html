    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Ashes Over Colors: Varanasi's Spiritual Holi</title>
    <meta name="description" content=""Masaan ki Holi" is a spiritual festival celebrated in Varanasi's cremation grounds, involving the use of ashes instead of colors.  Observed by ascetics and Shiva devotees, it symbolizes life's impermanence and mortality. 

The festival takes place at Manikarnika and Harishchandra Ghats, beginning after Rangbhari Ekadashi. A grand aarti at the Mahashmashan Nath Temple precedes the ritual of smearing ashes and chanting "Har Har Mahadev." 

It is believed that playing Holi with ashes pleases Lord Shiva and brings spiritual purification. The festival is not for everyone, particularly those with worldly attachments, families, or pursuing education.  Legends suggest that the absence of "Masaan ki Holi" could disrupt rituals that pay homage to Lord Shiva, potentially leading to Kashi's destruction.">
