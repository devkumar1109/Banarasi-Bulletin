    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh is rapidly becoming a major semiconductor hub in India, attracting ₹30,000 crore investments. Two key projects driving this growth are: a ₹3,706 crore joint venture between HCL and Foxconn to establish India's sixth semiconductor facility near Jewar airport, focusing on display driver chips, and a ₹27,000 crore investment by Tarq Semiconductors (Hiranandani Group) to build a fabrication unit in Noida for integrated circuits (ICs) and microchips.  

Uttar Pradesh's Semiconductor Policy-2024, launched in February 2024, offers attractive incentives like a 50% capital subsidy, 75% land discount, and 100% stamp duty exemption.  The state already contributes significantly to India's mobile phone and component manufacturing, creating a strong foundation for the semiconductor sector.">
