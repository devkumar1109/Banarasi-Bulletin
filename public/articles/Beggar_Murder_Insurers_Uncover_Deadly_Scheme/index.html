    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Beggar Murder: Insurers Uncover Deadly Scheme</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Four men in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, were arrested for murdering a disabled beggar, Daryab Singh, in July 2024. 

They staged the death as a hit-and-run accident and fraudulently obtained insurance policies in Singh's name, withdrawing Rs 10 lakh. They also siphoned off another Rs 5 lakh released under a government accident scheme into the deceased's wife's account. 

The accused, Hariom, Vinod Kumar, Pankaj Raghav (an insurance agent), and Pratap Kumar (a murder convict on bail), drugged Singh before striking him with a hammer and running him over.  An insurance firm's suspicion led to the reopening of the case which was initially closed by the police in December 2024.">
