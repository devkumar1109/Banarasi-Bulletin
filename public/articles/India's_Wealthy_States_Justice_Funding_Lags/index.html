    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - India's Wealthy States: Justice Funding Lags</title>
    <meta name="description" content="India’s 11 wealthiest states allocated Rs 1.97 lakh crore for their justice systems in 2024-25, a 36% increase from 2022-23. This funding, however, represented only 4% of their combined budget and 0.32% of their GSDP. 

Per capita spending on justice, excluding police, was Rs 389 per year.  Police received the largest share of funding due to their large workforce, infrastructure needs, and diverse tasks. 

While allocations increased, per capita spending remains low, and funding for training in police, judiciary, and prisons is insufficient.  Experts emphasize the need to prioritize justice system funding, particularly for forensic services which suffer from poor infrastructure and high vacancies.">
