    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Farmers Embrace Sustainable Rice-Wheat Practices</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A two-day training program on direct seeded rice (DSR) and zero tillage wheat (ZTW) was held in Varanasi for 70 farmers from Eastern Uttar Pradesh. The program, organized by the International Rice Research Institute-South Asia Regional Centre (ISARC), aimed to promote sustainable rice-wheat cultivation techniques. 

Experts from ISARC, IRRI, World Bank, Bayer Crop Science, and Savannah emphasized the need for agricultural transformation in the region. Farmers were introduced to DSR and ZTW, which offer benefits like reduced labor costs, water savings, and increased productivity. 

The training covered nutrient and weed management, mechanization, and hybrid rice varieties.  A field visit to ISARC's Mechanisation Hub provided hands-on experience with equipment and agronomic practices. The program concluded with discussions on scaling these practices and strengthening market linkages.">
