    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - RLD Expands, Targets Jat Votes in Haryana, Punjab</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Jayant Chaudhary's Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) is expanding beyond its West UP base to Haryana and Punjab. The party appointed former MLA Jagjeet Singh Sangwan as Haryana president and plans to announce a Punjab president after a May 4 meeting in Ludhiana.  

The RLD aims to leverage the legacy of Chaudhary Charan Singh, Jayant's grandfather, among farmers in these states.  While the party will contest the 2027 Punjab Assembly elections and the next Haryana Assembly elections, alliance decisions will be made closer to the polls.  RLD's expansion strategy relies heavily on Jat and Jat Sikh votes, a significant demographic in all three regions.">
