    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Ayurveda vs. Minamata: Mercury Debate Heats Up</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Anand K Chaudhary, a professor and chairman of the Scientific Advisory Group-Drug Development, Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make mercury available for Ayurvedic medicine.  

Chaudhary argues that while India is a signatory to the Minamata Convention and obligated to reduce mercury use, it should ethically preserve its traditional knowledge system by allowing mercury use in Ayurvedic medicine. He points out that Ayurvedic practitioners have safely used mercury in medicinal formulations for 1500 years, a practice that predates Western attempts. Chaudhary emphasizes that the Indian knowledge of transforming mercury into medicinal form through processes like Shodhan, Maran, and Sanskaar constitutes Intellectual Property Rights and should be protected.">
