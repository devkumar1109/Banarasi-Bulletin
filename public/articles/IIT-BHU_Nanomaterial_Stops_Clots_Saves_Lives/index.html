    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT-BHU: Nanomaterial Stops Clots, Saves Lives</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Researchers at IIT-BHU have developed Potassium Ferric Oxalate Nanoparticle (KFeOx-NPs), a novel material that prevents blood clotting and thrombosis without altering blood structure. This breakthrough aims to combat blood clot-related disorders like strokes, heart attacks, and pulmonary embolism, which are leading causes of mortality worldwide.  

KFeOx-NPs effectively prevent clotting for up to 48 hours in human blood samples and demonstrate clot-prevention abilities in a mouse thrombosis model.  The material offers a safer alternative to conventional anticoagulants like warfarin and heparin, which can cause side effects.  

The research findings were published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, and a patent has been filed for the nanomaterial.">
