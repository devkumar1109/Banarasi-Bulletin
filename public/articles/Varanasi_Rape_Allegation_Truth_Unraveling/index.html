    <meta name="description" content="A 19-year-old woman in Varanasi alleges she was raped by 23 men over six days, between March 29 and April 4. She filed a complaint on April 6, and 14 of the 23 accused have been arrested.

They also cite social media posts showing her seemingly unharmed. The police have formed an SIT to investigate both allegations, including inconsistencies in the survivor's account and CCTV footage showing her riding a bike during the alleged timeframe. The survivor's mother, deeply distressed, expressed her desire to meet PM Modi and seek justice for her daughter.">
