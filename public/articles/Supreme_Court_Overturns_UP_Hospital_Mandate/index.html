    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Supreme Court Overturns UP Hospital Mandate</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Supreme Court has overturned a 2018 Allahabad High Court order requiring Uttar Pradesh government officials to use only public hospitals for treatment. The High Court had issued the directive as part of a larger effort to improve government hospitals. 

The Supreme Court stated that such mandates interfere with policy decisions and limit individual choice in healthcare.  

The court also expressed concern that prioritizing government officials' healthcare could create inequities.  The judgement allows petitioners to file new petitions with specific data and facts before the High Court. 

The original High Court order, initiated by a woman who faced complications after childbirth, included directives to fill medical staff vacancies, ensure quality medicines and equipment, strengthen maternal healthcare, and conduct a CAG-led audit of government hospitals.">
