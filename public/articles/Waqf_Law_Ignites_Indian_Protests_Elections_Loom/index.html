    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Waqf Law Ignites Indian Protests: Elections Loom</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Protests are erupting across India against a new law concerning Waqf properties.  A Congress leader has taken the matter to the Supreme Court, making it a significant political issue.  

Political parties are capitalizing on the protests for electoral gains. Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh seeks to attract Muslim voters, while Vijay in Tamil Nadu joins the demonstrations due to the state's substantial Waqf properties and upcoming elections. 

With elections approaching in several states with large Muslim populations, including Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, and Uttar Pradesh, the protests are likely to intensify. Opposition parties are hoping to gain Muslim support by opposing the Waqf bill, while the BJP could benefit from anti-Muslim sentiment. 


Internal strife within Bihar's ruling party, JDU, and the potential entry of Prashant Kishor into the political fray further complicates the situation.">
