    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Beggar's Death: Insurance Fraud and Cold-Blooded Murder</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Four men in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, have been arrested for the murder of Daryab Singh, a disabled beggar. 

The crime was disguised as a hit-and-run accident in July 2024. The accused, Hariom, Vinod Kumar, Pankaj Raghav, and Pratap Kumar,  had fraudulently obtained insurance policies in Singh's name.  They killed him by getting him drunk and then striking him with a hammer before running him over with a car.  

They collected Rs 10 lakh from the insurance policies and another Rs 5 lakh from a government accident scheme, siphoning off the funds without the victim's wife's knowledge.  The case was reopened after an insurance firm suspected foul play.">
