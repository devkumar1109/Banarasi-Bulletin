    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - NSUI Challenges Bhagwat's "Talk the Talk" Hindutva</title>
    <meta name="description" content="NSUI activists protested against RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat during his visit to Varanasi, demanding he practice what he preaches about Hindutva. They attempted to offer him Maha Kumbh water, highlighting his absence from the religious ritual and questioning his commitment to Sanatan tradition. The activists alleged that Bhagwat engages in the politics of Hindutva but avoids its practical application. They believe his absence from the Maha Kumbh bath, a central part of Sanatan tradition, demonstrates that his Hindutva is limited to speeches and propaganda. The police detained several NSUI activists during the protest.">
