    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP's Green Expressway: Faster Trips, Greener Growth</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh is constructing a 380-km Ghaziabad-Kanpur Expressway, aiming to reduce travel time between the cities from eight hours to five and a half hours.  The expressway, developed under the Green Highway Policy, will connect nine districts: Ghaziabad, Hapur, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Kasganj, Farrukhabad, Kannauj, Unnao, and Kanpur.
