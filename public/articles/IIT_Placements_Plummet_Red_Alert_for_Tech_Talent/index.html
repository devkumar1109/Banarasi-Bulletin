    <meta name="description" content="Government data reveals a concerning decline in placements for BTech students at IITs. Over half of the 23 IITs experienced a drop of more than 10 percentage points in placements between 2021-22 and 2023-24.  

Notable declines were observed at older IITs like Madras (12 percentage points), Bombay (13 percentage points), Kanpur (11 percentage points), and Delhi (15 percentage points). IIT Dharwad suffered the sharpest drop, with placements falling by 25 percentage points. 

In 2021-22, 14 IITs recorded over 90% placements.  However, in 2023-24, only three IITs reached this mark, with IIT Jodhpur leading at 92.98%.  The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education highlighted this "unusual decline" in placements across IITs and IIITs.">
