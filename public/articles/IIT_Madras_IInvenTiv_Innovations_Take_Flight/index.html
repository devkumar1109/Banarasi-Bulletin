    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT Madras IInvenTiv: Innovations Take Flight</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The 3rd edition of IInvenTiv, a research and development fair at IIT Madras, showcased innovations from over 40 institutions.

Highlights include a low-flying "WIG" craft from IIT Madras that can travel 1600 km in 3 hours at 600 per seat, and a portable weather station from IIT (BHU) Varanasi that provides microclimatic information to farmers in local languages.

IIT Tirupati displayed porous radiant burners that can save up to 50% fuel in cooking. Other innovations included drones, underwater vehicles, AI-based collision avoidance systems, neonatal jaundice meters, and cow-dung-based construction material.

The exhibition aims to connect industry and government with higher educational institutions to finalize long-term goals.  


Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan highlighted India's emergence as the world's third-largest startup ecosystem with a valuation exceeding $354 million.">
