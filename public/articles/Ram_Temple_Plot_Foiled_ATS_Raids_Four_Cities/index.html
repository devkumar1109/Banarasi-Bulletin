    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Ram Temple Plot Foiled, ATS Raids Four Cities</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) conducted searches in four cities - Lucknow, Azamgarh, Mau, and Ballia - following the arrest of a 19-year-old man named Abdul Rehman from Faridabad. Rehman was allegedly planning an attack on the Ram temple in Ayodhya and was found with two hand grenades.  He was in contact with radical elements linked to international terror groups according to investigations. 

The ATS visited homes of individuals with questionable credentials to verify information received about their communication, particularly through emails.  Rehman, an e-rickshaw driver, supported his family and had a history of heart problems.  Locals observed a change in his behavior in recent months, including increased withdrawal and association with a specific group of young men.  His frequent trips to Faizabad, Delhi, and Visakhapatnam raised suspicion.">
