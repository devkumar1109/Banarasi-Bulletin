    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Inter Kashi Appeals Triumph, I-League Title Up in the Air</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Inter Kashi FC won their first appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the All India Football Federation (AIFF) regarding a three-point deduction for a disputed I-League match. The AIFF had initially deducted points after Inter Kashi's match against Namdhari FC, leading to Churchill Brothers being declared champions. 

The CAS ruling overturns the AIFF's decision. However, Inter Kashi still has a pending appeal with the CAS, which could ultimately determine the 2024-25 I-League champion. While the trophy has already been awarded to Churchill Brothers, the outcome of the second appeal could change the result.">
