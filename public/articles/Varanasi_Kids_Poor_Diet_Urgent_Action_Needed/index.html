    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Kids: Poor Diet, Urgent Action Needed</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A new study by Mahila Mahavidyalaya, BHU, reveals that primary school children in Varanasi are exhibiting poor dietary habits. The research, conducted between November 2023 and June 2024, found that various factors influence children's food choices, including individual taste preferences, family food rules, peer pressure, and media exposure.  

The study, published in BMC Public Health, suggests that parents and schools should act as positive role models for healthy eating. Parents need information and guidance on promoting healthy dietary habits, while schools should involve children in shaping food policies.  Training peers to be positive role models for healthy eating is also recommended.">
