    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Cauvery Aarti: Politics, Faith, and Water Woes</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Karnataka's Congress government held a grand Cauvery 'Aarti' ceremony at Bengaluru's Sankey Tank, drawing criticism and legal scrutiny. 

The event, inspired by Varanasi's Ganga Aarti, is seen by some as a political strategy to appeal to Hindu voters amid accusations of minority appeasement. Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar, who spearheaded the event, has been increasing his public engagement in Hindu religious activities. 

Environmentalists raised concerns about the ceremony's ecological impact on the urban water body, prompting the Karnataka High Court to direct authorities to follow legal provisions. The ceremony, which involved distributing water from Bhagamandala as "prasada," occurred despite ongoing water supply issues for farmers and the unresolved interstate dispute with Tamil Nadu.">
