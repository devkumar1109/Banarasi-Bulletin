    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - "Chhava" Film Ignites Hindu-Muslim Tensions in Maharashtra</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Bollywood movie "Chhava" depicting the capture and death of Chhatrapati Sambha Ji by Aurangzeb has sparked communal tensions. 

The movie's portrayal of Aurangzeb's cruelty and the destruction of Hindu religious places during his reign has ignited passions in Maharashtra, where Shivaji and Sambha Ji are revered.

The controversy escalated after Samajwadi MLA Abu Azmi praised Aurangzeb in the Maharashtra assembly, drawing condemnation from political opponents. 

The incident highlights the current "era of Hindu awakening," where statements perceived as anti-Hindu are met with strong reactions. 

The author argues that a Hindu awakening is necessary given the historical dominance and suppression of Hindus by Islamic rulers and British colonialism, which led to a decline in Hinduism's pursuit of knowledge and societal progress.">
