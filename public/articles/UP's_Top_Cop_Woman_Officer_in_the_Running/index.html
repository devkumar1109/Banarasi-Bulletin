    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP's Top Cop: Woman Officer in the Running</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh is set for a new Director General of Police (DGP) as acting DGP Prashant Kumar retires on May 31. This leadership change is historic as a woman officer, Tilotama Varma, is among the contenders.  Kumar, a 1990-batch IPS officer, took over in February 2024 and is known for his affiliation with CM Yogi Adityanath and his method of policing.  

Serving as DG Training, Varma is a 1990-batch IPS officer with experience in the CBI and a focus on gender and justice issues. Service extensions for DGPs in UP are rare, with only two officers receiving them in the last decade.  The UP Police is the country’s largest police force, and the selection process is closely watched.">
