    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Seeks Trade War Triumph Through MSMEs</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh aims to leverage the US-China tariff war to boost its MSME sector exports.  The state, with 96 lakh MSMEs, is the fourth largest exporter in India and first among landlocked states.  

Major exports include carpets, leather goods, handicrafts, and processed meats. To promote "Brand UP", the government will participate in an international trade show and advertise heavily at railway stations and airports.  

An export promotion fund will also be established. Additionally, a dedicated leather and footwear export policy is being developed, aiming to increase exports from the sector, which currently contributes 46% of the national share. The One District One Product Scheme has already significantly increased UP's exports, and the government targets tripling this by 2030.">
