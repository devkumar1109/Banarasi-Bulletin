    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - SC Slams UP Police for Criminalizing Civil Disputes</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Supreme Court criticized the Uttar Pradesh Police for repeatedly converting civil disputes into criminal cases. Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna called this practice "absurd" and a "complete breakdown of the rule of law," stating that not paying money cannot be considered a criminal offense. 

The criticism stemmed from a case involving a money dispute where the police filed a chargesheet to transform a civil case into a criminal one. The petitioner alleged bribery by the police in this conversion. The court stayed the criminal prosecution and ordered the Investigating Officer to appear in court and justify the charges.  

The CJI warned that the police would face costs for filing similar petitions in the future, directing the DGP and the IO to provide a response within two weeks. This instance highlights a concerning trend of the UP Police abusing their power by converting civil matters into criminal ones, burdening the already strained criminal justice system.">
