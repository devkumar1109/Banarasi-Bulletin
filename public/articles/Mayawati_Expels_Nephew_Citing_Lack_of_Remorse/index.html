    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Mayawati Expels Nephew, Citing Lack of Remorse</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati expelled her nephew Akash Anand from the party on Monday. This follows Akash's removal from all key party posts on Sunday due to his alleged influence from his father-in-law, Ashok Siddharth. 

Mayawati deemed Akash's response to his removal "selfish, arrogant, and non-missionary," stating it lacked remorse and political maturity.  She emphasized this decision was made to protect the party's integrity and honor the principles of party founders Baba Saheb Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar and Manaywar Shri Kanshiram ji. 

This expulsion comes after Mayawati previously sacked Akash last year but later reinstated him, appointing him her political successor.">
