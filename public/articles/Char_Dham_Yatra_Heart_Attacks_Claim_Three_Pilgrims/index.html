    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Char Dham Yatra: Heart Attacks Claim Three Pilgrims</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Three pilgrims from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu died of heart attacks during the Char Dham yatra on Thursday.  This brings the total number of pilgrim deaths this year to over 89.  Ram Kumar (62), Bato Bai Yadav (65), and Venu Gopal (70) died on the Kedarnath, Yamunotri, and Gangotri routes respectively. 

Most pilgrim deaths this year are attributed to health issues, primarily cardiac-related. The challenging altitude and extreme cold of the Himalayas pose risks for pilgrims with underlying health conditions. Authorities highlight the robust health infrastructure in place along the yatra route, including medical personnel, oxygen-equipped beds, and ambulances.">
