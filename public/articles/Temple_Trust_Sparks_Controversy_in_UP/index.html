    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Temple Trust Sparks Controversy in UP</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh government constituted a trust to manage the Banke Bihari temple in Mathura as part of plans to redevelop the Banke Bihari corridor.  SP chief Akhilesh Yadav criticized the move, accusing the BJP government of "indirectly taking control of prominent temples" under the guise of better administration.  

The Department of Religious Affairs, revived by Akhilesh Yadav during his tenure as CM, was re-energized by the Yogi Adityanath government, which established several development parishads for religious sites. The department's mandate is to develop religious institutions and temples, providing basic facilities to devotees.  

The move to establish a trust for the Banke Bihari temple follows the success of the Kashi Vishwanath corridor project in Varanasi, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2022.">
