    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - India's Justice System: Broken, Backlogged, and Begging for Reform</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The India Justice Report 2025 reveals a deeply flawed justice system plagued by underfunding, inequality, and slow reform.  Police forces lack adequate training, with only 1.25% of their budget allocated to it.  Gender disparity is evident as no state meets reserved quotas for women in police.  Forensic science is understaffed, with half of sanctioned positions vacant, hindering investigations.  Overcrowding in prisons is severe, with 176 prisons exceeding 200% capacity. Judicial backlogs are immense, with over 5 crore cases pending.  Legal aid services are declining, particularly in rural areas.  Prisoner welfare also suffers with inadequate provisions.  Despite some positive developments, like increased digital infrastructure and growing female representation in the judiciary, the report paints a dire picture, demanding urgent systemic reform to ensure justice for all.">
