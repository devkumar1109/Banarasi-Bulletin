    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Nationalism Battleground: BJP vs. Congress</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The BJP and Congress are engaged in a fierce battle for the nationalist narrative following Operation Sindoor, the recent Indo-Pak conflict.  The BJP launched the 11-day Tiranga Yatra, highlighting the government's response to Pakistan and promoting national unity. They have emphasized India's military strength, particularly the BrahMos missile, and used anti-Pakistan rhetoric. The Congress, meanwhile, organized nationwide "Jai Hind" rallies, accusing the BJP of politicising the operation and highlighting alleged intelligence failures and foreign interference. The BJP's strategy blends subaltern Hindutva with muscular nationalism, while the Congress focuses on criticizing the government's handling of the conflict. With elections approaching, the political war over Operation Sindoor is intensifying.">
