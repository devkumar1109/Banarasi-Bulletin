    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Greens Up: Miyawaki Magic Fights Pollution</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Varanasi government is implementing a large-scale tree-planting campaign to combat rising temperatures and air pollution.

Using the Japanese Miyawaki technique, three new forest areas are being developed, with 5.617 hectares already established in nine locations. This method allows saplings to mature in two years, creating dense forests.

The initiative includes the creation of "natural oxygen banks" or "lungs of the city," aiming to reduce pollution and provide clean air. 

Programs like the National Clean Air Mission, forest fund financing, and municipal corporation financing support this effort.

Since 2020-21, 1,70,246 trees have been planted in nine locations, and three new locations, including Ramna STP Plant and Banas Dairy Amul, have begun planting.">
