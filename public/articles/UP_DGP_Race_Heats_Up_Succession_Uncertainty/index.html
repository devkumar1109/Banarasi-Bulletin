    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP DGP Race Heats Up: Succession Uncertainty</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh's DGP Prashant Kumar is retiring on May 31st, 2025, leaving a vacancy in the crucial post.  The appointment of his successor is uncertain, with the government debating whether to follow new cabinet rules or send a panel to the UPSC.  

Several senior IPS officers are considered frontrunners for the DGP position, including Sandeep Salunke, Daljit Singh Chaudhary, and Renuka Mishra.  Other candidates include MK Bashal, Tilottama Verma, and Alok Sharma. 

The retirement of three DG-rank officers in May is anticipated to significantly impact the IPS seniority list, potentially propelling Salunke, Chaudhary, and Mishra into top leadership roles.  There is also a possibility of Prashant Kumar receiving a three-month service extension.">
