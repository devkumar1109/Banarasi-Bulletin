    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Ansal Group in FIR Crosshairs for Homebuyer Betrayal</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh Police has filed an FIR against the Ansal Group on charges of cheating, criminal conspiracy, breach of trust, and organized crime.  This action follows directives from Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who ordered strict action against those responsible for the Ansal API bankruptcy crisis.  Thousands of homebuyers have been affected by the bankruptcy.  

CM Yogi directed statewide FIRs in all districts where homebuyers have reported fraud by the Ansal Group. A committee comprising representatives from the LDA and aggrieved buyers was formed to gather evidence against Ansal API. The CM also expressed displeasure over the NCLAT declaring Ansal API bankrupt without notifying the LDA and Housing Department, and ordered authorities to appeal the decision.">
