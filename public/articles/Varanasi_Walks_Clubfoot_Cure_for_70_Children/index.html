    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Walks: Clubfoot Cure for 70 Children</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Since 2019, a child health scheme in Varanasi has helped 70 children recover from clubfoot.  512 children have been treated under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram and Anushka foundation program.  In April 2025, nine children received treatment, with six undergoing surgery.  Free clubfoot OPDs are available at three hospitals in Varanasi.  

The Ponseti method is used to treat clubfoot, involving casting, a minor outpatient procedure called tenotomy, and wearing a brace for several years.  The CMO encourages parents to notify local health centers if they suspect their child has clubfoot to ensure free and proper treatment. Registration for treatment and monitoring is available at sabalkashi.com.  Clubfoot affects approximately one in 800 children.">
