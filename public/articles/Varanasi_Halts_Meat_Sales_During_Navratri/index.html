    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Halts Meat Sales During Navratri</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Varanasi Municipal Corporation (MC) has ordered the closure of all meat and fish shops within city limits during Navratri, which begins on March 30th and concludes on April 7th. This decision, aimed at respecting religious traditions and the sentiments of devotees observing fasts, was unanimously approved in the corporation's executive meeting. 

Around 400-500 meat and fish shops will be affected by the order. Shopkeepers violating the order will face legal action.  This move follows a January directive to close meat shops within a two-kilometer radius of the Vishwanath Temple, which has already been enforced.  



Meat shop owners, however, allege harassment, claiming they are being forced to close without alternative arrangements.">
