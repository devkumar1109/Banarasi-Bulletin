    <meta name="description" content="In Gonda, Uttar Pradesh, the STF and police organized a wedding for a young woman from a family devastated by a robbery and double murder that occurred on April 24-25. The family had to cancel the wedding due to the tragedy. 

The UP police, led by STF Chief Amitabh Yash, arranged the entire wedding, covering all expenses, including jewelry, gifts, and essential items. STF Deputy SP Dharmendra Shahi supervised the arrangements, and his wife, a member of the Uttar Pradesh State Women’s Commission, performed the kanyadaan.

This heartwarming act came after swift justice was served, with two of the culprits killed in an encounter and three others jailed. The event demonstrated the police's commitment to both law enforcement and public service, offering solace and support to the bereaved family.">
