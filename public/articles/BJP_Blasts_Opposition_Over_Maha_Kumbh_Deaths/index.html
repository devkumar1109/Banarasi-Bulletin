    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BJP Blasts Opposition Over Maha Kumbh Deaths</title>
    <meta name="description" content="BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi accused the opposition of seeking political gain from the Maha Kumbh tragedy, citing Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav's questioning of the death toll. Trivedi criticized Yadav's past skepticism towards COVID-19 vaccines, the Ram Mandir consecration, and now the Maha Kumbh deaths, calling it a lack of sensitivity. 

He also condemned remarks like "Mrityu Kumbh" used by opposition parties, highlighting their alleged attempts to dismantle Hinduism. Trivedi praised the Maha Kumbh's success, attributing it to PM Modi's policies that have revitalized tourism in India. 

He further criticized the opposition's stance on the US deportation of illegal Indian immigrants, accusing them of opposing India's efforts against illegal Bangladeshi immigrants due to their alleged vote bank considerations.">
