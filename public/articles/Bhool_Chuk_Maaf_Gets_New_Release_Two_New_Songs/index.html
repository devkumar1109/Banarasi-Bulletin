    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - "Bhool Chuk Maaf" Gets New Release, Two New Songs</title>
    <meta name="description" content=""Bhool Chuk Maaf", starring Rajkummar Rao and Wamiqa Gabbi, has been pushed back to a May 9 release.  Two new songs are being added to the romantic comedy. The first, a peppy promotional track composed by Tanishk Bagchi, was filmed in March.  

The second song, with a romantic bachelorette party vibe, will be shot in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, in mid-April. Both songs are choreographed by Vijay Ganguly and feature costumes by Sheetal Sharma.  The film revolves around Rao's character getting stuck in a time loop a day before his wedding.  

This is the first collaboration between Rao and Gabbi, who was previously seen in "Baby John" and "Khufiya". "Bhool Chuk Maaf" also stars Seema Pahwa and is produced by Dinesh Vijan.">
