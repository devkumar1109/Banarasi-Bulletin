    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath accused previous governments of fostering cheating in board exams and promoting a culture of transfer-posting. He claimed his government has implemented a transparent exam system with CCTV surveillance and shorter exam durations to curb malpractices.  

Adityanath highlighted his government's job creation efforts, stating that over 800,000 youths have been given government jobs transparently. He also pointed to increased female recruitment in the police force, with over 12,000 women recruited compared to only 10,000 from 1947 to 2017.  

At an event honoring national school sports competition medalists, Adityanath called for public responsibility in protecting national property.  Uttar Pradesh athletes won 179 medals at the 68th National School Sports Competition, with the state government offering financial rewards for medalists.">
