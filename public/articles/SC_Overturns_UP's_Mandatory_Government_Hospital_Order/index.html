    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - SC Overturns UP's Mandatory Government Hospital Order</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Supreme Court overturned a 2018 Allahabad High Court order requiring government officials in Uttar Pradesh to exclusively use government hospitals for treatment. The Supreme Court ruled that such directives interfere with policy decisions and limit individual choice in medical treatment.  

The High Court had issued the order as part of a broader effort to improve healthcare in government hospitals, prompted by a PIL filed by a woman who faced post-delivery complications and had to seek expensive private treatment due to alleged negligence at a government hospital. 

The High Court had issued 21 directives, including ordering the filling of medical staff vacancies, ensuring quality medicines and equipment, strengthening maternal healthcare, and conducting a CAG-led audit of government hospitals.">
