    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Doctor Dies in Jail: Bribe Accusation Sparks Outrage</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Dr. Venkatesh Maur, superintendent of Bansdih Community Health Centre (CHC) in Ballia, died in Varanasi district jail. He was arrested last Thursday for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 20,000. Doctors in Ballia have suspended outpatient services at all government health centres in protest, demanding a CBI inquiry into his death. They allege foul play, claiming he was healthy before his arrest and his death in judicial custody raises serious questions. The Provincial Medical Services Association (PMSA) has warned of further action if no investigation is launched within three days.  Retired IPS officer Amitabh Thakur has also demanded an inquiry, alleging inhuman treatment and extortion by jail officials.">
