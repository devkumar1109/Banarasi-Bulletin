    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi's 10-Point Plan: Eradicating Child Malnutrition</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, a 10-point strategy implemented by IAS officers S Rajalingam and Himanshu Nagpal has significantly reduced malnutrition in children.  

The strategy, launched in response to high rates of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM), focused on improving Anganwadi centres, providing nutritional support, and setting up Mini Nutritional Rehabilitation Centres (NRCs). 

The district administration renovated and built new Anganwadi centres, ensuring children had a safe and accessible space to receive nutritional support. A comprehensive program, 'Abhinav Pehel', provided daily iron and multivitamin supplements, millet-based supplements, and fortified foods to children and mothers.

These efforts have resulted in a dramatic decrease in SAM, reducing cases from 24,820 to just 316 in three years.">
