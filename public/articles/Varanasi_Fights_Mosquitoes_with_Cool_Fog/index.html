    <meta name="description" content="In Varanasi, a trial of cold fogging is underway to combat dengue and malaria. 

This method, supervised by CDO Himanshu Nagpal, involves spraying a mist of insecticide mixed with water instead of smoke, minimizing environmental pollution. 

The trial was successful in Prime Minister's Model Village Kurhua and will be used in 45 houses surrounding dengue/malaria patients. 

Cold fogging will be implemented in sensitive village panchayats and wards, especially during July-November when mosquito-borne diseases are prevalent.  
 It will also be used in hospitals and hot spot areas for preventive action.">
