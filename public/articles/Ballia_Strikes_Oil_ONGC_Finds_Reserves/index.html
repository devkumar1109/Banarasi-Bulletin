    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Ballia Strikes Oil: ONGC Finds Reserves</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has discovered crude oil reserves in Ballia, Uttar Pradesh, after a three-month survey.  The reserves were found at a depth of 3,000 meters on land owned by the family of freedom fighter Chittu Pandey. ONGC has leased six-and-a-half acres for three years, paying an annual rent of Rs 10 lakh. Drilling is underway and requires 25,000 liters of water daily.  

The project is expected to be completed by April 2025. If commercially viable, ONGC plans to drill more wells in the 300-km oil belt extending to Prayagraj and acquire more land. The discovery could boost the region's economy and establish Ballia as a key oil-producing area.">
