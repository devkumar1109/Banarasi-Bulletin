    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Bans Meat, Fish During Navratri</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Varanasi Municipal Corporation has ordered the closure of all meat and fish shops within city limits during Navratri, which begins March 30 and ends April 7. This decision, approved unanimously in the corporation's executive meeting, is intended to respect religious sentiments and accommodate devotees who fast during the festival. 

Around 400-500 meat and fish shops will be affected. Shopkeepers violating the order face legal action.  

This follows a previous directive in January, where meat shops within a two-kilometer radius of the Vishwanath Temple were ordered to shut down.  Although no such shops currently operate in that area, owners have alleged harassment and lack of alternative arrangements.">
