    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Dancing for Salvation: Varanasi's Ritual Firelight</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Varanasi, sex workers known as 'Nagar Vadhus'  traditionally dance around burning pyres at the Manikarnika Ghat during the three-day Shringar Festival of Mahashmashan Nath. This culminates the festival, held from the fifth to seventh day of Chaitra Navratra. Held for centuries, the tradition involves tantric rituals, devotional songs, and prayers, with the women seeking salvation and a better next life. 

The festival is believed to have originated when Raja Sawai Man Singh, who renovated the Mahashamshan Nath temple, invited sex workers to perform music after no other artists were willing.  
 
Flowers adorn the ghat during the festival, and the women perform traditional dances and songs, including "Durga Durgati Nashini", "Dimig Dimig Damru Kar Baje", and "Om Namah Shivaya".">
