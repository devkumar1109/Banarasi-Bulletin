    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Yadav's Suheldev Statue: SP Targets OBC Votes</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav has started campaigning for the 2027 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, focusing on the Other Backward Classes (OBCs). He has promised to install a statue of Raja Suheldev at the Gomti riverfront in Lucknow if the SP comes to power. This move is seen as an attempt to woo the Rajbhar community, estimated to constitute 18% of the electorate in eastern Uttar Pradesh, who claim affinity with Raja Suheldev.  

The BJP has traditionally leveraged the OBC vote bank through its social coalition strategy, which includes representation for OBCs, Dalits, and Adivasis in power structures.  The SP aims to counter this by increasing its outreach to these communities.">
