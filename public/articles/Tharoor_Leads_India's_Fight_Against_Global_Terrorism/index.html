    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Tharoor Leads India's Fight Against Global Terrorism</title>
    <meta name="description" content="An Indian delegation led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor visited New York to strengthen India's global stance against terrorism. They met with academics, think tanks, and media, emphasizing India's zero-tolerance policy and the need for firm global mechanisms to counter terror. 

The visit included a stop at the 9/11 Memorial, where they honored victims and called for international cooperation to dismantle terror networks. The delegation also planned visits to four other countries to further engage with public and political figures about global peace. 

Recently, a terrorist attack in Kashmir killed 26 people, including 25 Indians and one Nepalese. Despite this, there was no religious backlash in India, demonstrating the nation's unity in rejecting attempts to divide them.">
