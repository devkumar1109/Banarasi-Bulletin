    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Alien Ocean: DMS Found on Exoplanet K2-18b</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Dr. Nikku Madhusudhan, an Indian-origin astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge, and his team have detected dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the atmosphere of K2-18b, an exoplanet 120 light-years from Earth. DMS is a biosignature found exclusively on Earth, produced by living organisms, primarily marine algae. 

This discovery, using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), strengthens the hypothesis that K2-18b, a "sub-Neptune" planet, could support life.  While not confirming life, the detection of DMS, alongside methane and carbon dioxide, suggests K2-18b may have a warm ocean teeming with life.  

This finding is a significant step in the search for extraterrestrial life and addresses the Fermi Paradox, the contradiction between the high probability of extraterrestrial life and the lack of evidence.">
