    <meta name="description" content="Delhi Crime Branch arrested notorious serial killer Dr. Devender Sharma, alias 'Doctor Death,' from a Rajasthan ashram. Sharma, a 67-year-old Ayurvedic doctor, was serving multiple life sentences for 21 murders and involvement in a kidney transplant racket.  He jumped parole in August 2023 after being granted parole for a 2004 murder case. This was not his first escape, as he had previously absconded for seven months in 2020 after jumping parole. A dedicated Crime Branch operation led by Inspector Rakesh Kumar tracked him down to the ashram where he was posing as a priest. During interrogation, Sharma confessed to his crimes and admitted to evading return to prison.">
