    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Senate Averts Shutdown, Partisan Divide Persists</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The U.S. Senate narrowly passed a Republican-led funding bill, averting a government shutdown. The bill passed with a vote of 54-46, increasing military spending while reducing non-defense funds.  Democrats supported the bill to prevent a shutdown but criticized it for granting President Donald Trump excessive control over federal spending, calling it a "blank cheque." Despite concerns, Democrats prioritized avoiding harm to the American people. The vote highlights the ongoing partisan divide over budget priorities. Democrats urge Republicans to consider broader national needs in future negotiations, emphasizing the need for balanced spending between military and non-defense sectors.">
