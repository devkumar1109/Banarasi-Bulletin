    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh DGP Prashant Kumar is retiring on May 31st, leading to discussions about his successor.  

The state government recently changed rules for DGP selection, but no committee has been formed yet.  Three senior officers, including Kumar, are retiring,  reshuffling the seniority list and bringing officers like Sandeep Salunke, Daljit Singh Chaudhary, and Renuka Mishra to the forefront.  

Contenders for the DGP position include Chaudhary, Atul Sharma, and Rajiv Krishna.  

Tilottama Verma, currently DG Training, is a senior-most officer and potential first woman DGP for Uttar Pradesh.  Verma has extensive experience, including a long stint with the CBI, and her husband, Ashish Gupta, also an IPS officer, recently applied for voluntary retirement.">
