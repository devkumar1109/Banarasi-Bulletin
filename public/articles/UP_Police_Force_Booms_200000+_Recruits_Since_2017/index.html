    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Police Force Booms: 200,000+ Recruits Since 2017</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh Police has recruited over 200,000 personnel since 2017, significantly expanding its force.  

The recent recruitment of 60,244 constables brings the total strength to nearly 400,000, including around 36,000 women personnel. This surge in recruitment is attributed to the government's focus on modernizing the police force and improving infrastructure.  

Major recruitment milestones include 49,568 personnel inducted in 2020, with a focus on gender diversity, and 8,362 sub-inspectors and equivalent ranks in 2024, including a record number of women sub-inspectors. 


A new recruitment drive is planned to fill 28,138 vacancies, including sub-inspector and constable positions, further strengthening the force.">
