    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh government aims to increase silk production by connecting 7,500 rural groups to the State Rural Livelihood Mission in 2025-26. This initiative focuses on 15 districts, providing training, modern technology, and financial assistance to silk producers. An agreement between the State Rural Livelihood Mission and the Silk Department targets connecting 50,000 women from 5,000 women's groups to silk production within five years.  

The state's annual silk production is 400 metric tonnes, while consumption reaches 3,500 metric tonnes. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath launched the Mukhyamantri Resham Vikas Yojana to make the state self-reliant in silk production. Silk exports from Uttar Pradesh have grown 28-fold in the past eight years.">
