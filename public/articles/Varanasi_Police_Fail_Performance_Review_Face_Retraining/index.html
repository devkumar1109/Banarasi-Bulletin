    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Police Fail Performance Review, Face Retraining</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Varanasi, over 150 police sub-inspectors were sidelined for retraining after failing a first-of-its-kind commissionerate performance review.  Over 100 scored zero, and more than 50 couldn't draft basic FIRs.  Performance was particularly poor in handling public grievances, with 100% failing to address complaints on the CM's dashboard, IGRS.

180 officers were removed from field duties and attached to the lines.  6 officers were deemed "star performers". Retraining includes physical drills, legal education, FIR writing, investigation techniques, and public interaction protocols.">
