    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Manufacturing: $40 Billion Boom by 2025-26</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The manufacturing sector in Uttar Pradesh is projected to attract Rs 3 lakh crore in investments in 2025-26. This follows a strong performance in 2024-25 where the sector contributed Rs 2.81 lakh crore to the state's Gross State Value Addition (GSVA) and attracted Rs 50,000 crore in investments. The sector's growth is attributed to an investment-friendly environment and initiatives under Invest UP 2.0.  The Yogi Adityanath government is focusing on establishing new manufacturing units, attracting FDI, and developing a land and raw material bank.  Aligarh, Unnao, Prayagraj, and Jhunsi are being designated as special investment regions to further boost manufacturing in the state.">
