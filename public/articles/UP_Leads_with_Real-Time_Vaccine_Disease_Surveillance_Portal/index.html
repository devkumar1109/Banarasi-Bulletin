    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Leads with Real-Time Vaccine Disease Surveillance Portal</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh has become the first state to implement real-time digital surveillance of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) using its Unified Disease Surveillance Portal (UDSP), launched on May 1, 2025. The platform enables real-time case reporting and accurate data collection for six VPDs: poliomyelitis, measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus. Integrated with the Universal Immunization Program (UIP) and supported by the World Health Organization's National Public Health Support Network (NPSN), UDSP facilitates rapid communication between districts and the state, enhancing public health response and timely disease identification. The platform also allows citizens to access lab reports online. Additionally, UP is conducting a school-based TD vaccination campaign during World Immunisation Week, providing free TD vaccines to students in grades 5 and 10 in both public and private schools.  This initiative aims to improve vaccination coverage and ensure a safe future for children through accessible and timely healthcare data.">
