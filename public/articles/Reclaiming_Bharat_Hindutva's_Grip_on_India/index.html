    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - "Reclaiming Bharat: Hindutva's Grip on India"</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Ashutosh, author of "Reclaiming Bharat," views Narendra Modi's rise as a "right-wing revolution" that disrupted India's constitutional consensus.  He argues that the 2024 election, while showing potential cracks in the BJP's Hindutva project, demonstrates the RSS's continued commitment to dismantling Gandhian and Nehruvian ideals. Ashutosh compares the 2014 power shift from Manmohan Singh to Modi with India's independence, highlighting the ideological shift. His book analyzes this change, building upon his earlier work "Hindu Rashtra" which dissected the first five years of Modi's government.">
