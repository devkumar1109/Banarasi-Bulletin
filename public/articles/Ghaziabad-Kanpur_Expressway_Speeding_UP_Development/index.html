    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Ghaziabad-Kanpur Expressway: Speeding UP Development</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh will see a major infrastructure boost with the construction of the 380-km Ghaziabad-Kanpur Expressway.  This expressway will reduce travel time between the two cities from eight hours to 5 hours and 30 minutes. 

The project, developed under the Green Highway Policy, will connect nine districts: Ghaziabad, Hapur, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Kasganj, Farrukhabad, Kannauj, Unnao, and Kanpur. 

Expected to be completed by 2026, the expressway will initially be a four-lane highway, with the possibility for expansion to six lanes.  It will connect with major highways like NH-9 and the Kanpur-Lucknow Expressway, and provide access to Noida's Jewar Airport.   The expressway is anticipated to drive economic growth, create jobs, and improve connectivity across the region.">
