    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT-BHU's Drowning Detection: Swim Safe with Tech</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Researchers at IIT-BHU have developed a portable drowning monitoring system designed to protect swimmers and fishermen.  The device uses real-time sensors and data analytics to detect early signs of drowning and sends instant alerts to nearby responders or mobile devices. 

The system monitors vital health metrics like heart rate, location, and depth, providing valuable health data for users. It is particularly beneficial for vulnerable groups like children and the elderly. IIT-BHU has secured a patent for the technology and is conducting commercial trials.  This innovation aligns with the Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat initiatives, aiming to provide a scalable and impactful solution to water safety challenges.">
