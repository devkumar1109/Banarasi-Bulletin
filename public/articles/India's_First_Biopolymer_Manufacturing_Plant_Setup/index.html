    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - "India's Sweet Solution: Rs 2,850 Crore Biopolymer Plant to Replace Single-Use Plastics"</title>
    <meta name="description" content="India's first biopolymer manufacturing plant will be set up in Uttar Pradesh with an investment of Rs 2,850 crore. The plant, owned by Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd, will manufacture eco-friendly alternatives to single-use plastics in Kumbhi, Lakhimpur Kheri district. It will produce Polylactic Acid (PLA) from sugar, corn, and tapioca, used to make biodegradable items like cups and cutlery. The plant will support India's net zero emissions target and operate on renewable energy, commencing operations by December 2026 with an initial capacity of 80,000 tonnes. It will generate employment and advance the 'Make in India' vision, with technological advancements aimed at reducing sugar requirements from 1.6kg to 1.2kg per kilogram of PLA. BCML has collaborated with Alpine and Sulzer for technology transfer, eyeing a share of the global PLA market.">
