    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Farmers Embrace DSR, ZTW for Sustainable Farming</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A two-day training program on direct seeded rice (DSR) and zero tillage wheat (ZTW) was held at the International Rice Research Institute-South Asia Regional Centre (ISARC) in Varanasi. 

70 farmers from eight districts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh participated in the program, which featured expert discussions, technology showcases, and field demonstrations.

The training highlighted the benefits of DSR and ZTW, such as reduced labor costs, water savings, and improved productivity. ISARC director Sudhanshu Singh emphasized the potential of agriculture in Eastern UP and the institute's commitment to supporting farmers with improved technologies and market linkages.

The program covered topics like nutrient management, weed management, and mechanization, with input from private sector representatives like Bayer Crop Science and Savannah. Farmers gained hands-on experience at ISARC's Mechanisation Hub, learning about seed drill calibration and equipment maintenance.">
