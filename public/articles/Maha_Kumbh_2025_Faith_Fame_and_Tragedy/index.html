    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Maha Kumbh 2025: Faith, Fame, and Tragedy</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Maha Kumbh 2025 in Prayagraj concluded on February 26th with over 66 crore attendees taking a holy dip at the Sangam, the confluence of rivers Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati. The 45-day event began on January 13th and saw a record-breaking number of visitors.  

The Kumbh Mela wasn't just about the spiritual gathering; it also saw viral moments like the internet sensation 'Monalisa' (Moni Bhosle), a garland seller from Madhya Pradesh, and 'IIT Baba', an ascetic who claimed to be an IIT graduate.  Sadly, the event was also marred by stampedes at the mela site and New Delhi Railway Station, resulting in the deaths of over 45 people.">
