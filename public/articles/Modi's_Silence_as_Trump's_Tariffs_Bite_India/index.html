Prime Minister Modi's focus on religious gatherings and domestic political matters, rather than addressing the economic crisis, has been criticized as a dereliction of duty.  Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, while highlighting domestic economic issues like wealth inequality and crony capitalism, also criticized Modi for not sufficiently engaging with Trump on the tariff issue.  Gandhi suggested that a more assertive stance from Modi could have mitigated the impact of Trump's policies.">
