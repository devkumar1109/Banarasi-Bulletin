    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Kumbh Legacy: Resources Reimagined for Pilgrim Comfort</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Following the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025, resources are being repurposed to enhance pilgrim facilities across Uttar Pradesh. A steamer used during the Kumbh will be sent to Ayodhya for river tours, while another will go to Chandauli. Water ATMs installed at the Kumbh will be relocated to Ayodhya, Vindhyachal, Mathura, and Panki in Kanpur. 

Public Works Department equipment like chequered plates and pontoons will be distributed to Mirzapur, Gorakhpur, Lakhimpur, and Kanpur. Approximately Rs 1,550 crore worth of equipment, including vehicles, compactors, street lights, and transformers, will be redistributed among districts.  

Special attention is given to Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Lucknow, and Chandauli, which will receive generators, waste management vehicles, and water ATMs. All 17 municipal corporations will receive supplies based on need.  Health department equipment will remain in Prayagraj, while sanitation vehicles will be assigned to the Prayagraj Municipal Corporation.">
