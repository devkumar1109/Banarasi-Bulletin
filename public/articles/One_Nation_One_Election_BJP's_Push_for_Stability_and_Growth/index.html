    <meta name="description" content="BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said "One Nation, One Election" aligns with the Constitution's original intent and is necessary for economic development and political stability.

Trivedi emphasized the need for a stable government, citing the 2014-present period under Narendra Modi as an example of stable governance leading to long-term development plans. He also pointed to the success of the Jan Dhan Yojana, which has benefitted millions through direct benefit transfers.
