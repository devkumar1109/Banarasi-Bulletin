    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh's new Global Capability Centres (GCC) policy aims to establish the state as a prominent office space hub, creating over 2 lakh high-paying jobs in five years. 

The policy offers substantial incentives, including a 30-50% front-end subsidy on land cost, a 25% capital subsidy up to Rs 10 crore for Level-1 GCCs and Rs 25 crore for advanced GCCs, and 100% stamp duty exemption. 

These incentives are performance-based, focusing on job creation, export growth, and technological innovation.  

The policy categorizes GCCs into two levels: Level 1 (minimum investment of Rs 15-20 crore or 100-200 employees) and Advanced GCCs (higher investment and employment).">
