    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - India Powers AI with Nuclear-Fueled Ambition</title>
    <meta name="description" content="India is strategically investing in AI by developing a comprehensive AI stack, from semiconductor fabrication to large language models (LLMs). The nation aims to build sovereign LLMs that reflect Indian context and culture.  Nuclear energy is a key component of this strategy, with a planned investment of Rs 20,000 crore in Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) to power AI infrastructure.  This move aligns with India's goal of increasing its nuclear capacity to 100 GW by 2047.  The government recognizes nuclear energy's reliability and cost-effectiveness in meeting the high energy demands of AI.  India's participation in the AI Action Summit in Paris demonstrates its commitment to being a key player in the global AI ecosystem.">
