    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Gang Rape: Accused Families Dispute Claims</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A 19-year-old woman in Varanasi alleged she was gang-raped by 23 people between March 29 and April 4. 14 of the accused have been arrested, while the arrest of the remaining 9 is pending a Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe. 

Families of some accused claim the survivor demanded money to remove names from the complaint and question her actions during the alleged assault, citing inconsistencies in her account and social media posts showing her seemingly unharmed. 

Police are examining CCTV footage showing the survivor riding a bike during the alleged rape period and investigating why she didn't return home despite being near it. The survivor's mother wants to meet PM Modi to narrate her daughter's trauma and seek justice.">
