    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP DGP Race Heats Up: Succession Speculation</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh DGP Prashant Kumar retires on May 31, leading to speculation about his successor.  The government is undecided on whether to follow new cabinet rules or send a panel to the UPSC for appointment. No panel has been sent yet, and a DGP selection committee under the new rules is pending.  

Sandeep Salunke, Daljit Singh Chaudhary, and Renuka Mishra are considered frontrunners for the DGP post, along with MK Bashal, Tilottama Verma, and Alok Sharma.  

A potential three-month extension for Prashant Kumar is possible with the Government of India's permission.  

Three DG-rank officers, including Kumar, retiring in May will cause a major shift in the IPS seniority list, potentially elevating Salunke, Chaudhary, and Mishra to top positions.">
