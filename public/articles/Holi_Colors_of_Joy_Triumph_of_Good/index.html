    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Holi: Colors of Joy, Triumph of Good</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Millions across South Asia celebrated Holi, the Hindu festival of color, marking the arrival of spring. Observed on the last full moon of Falgun, Holi involves joyous gatherings, throwing colored powders, music, dance, sweets, and prayers.  

The festival's origin is rooted in legends, particularly the story of demon king Hiranyakashipu and his son Prahlad. Prahlad's devotion to Lord Vishnu angered his father, who plotted his death.  Hiranyakashipu's sister Holika, with a fire immunity boon, tried to kill Prahlad on a pyre, but the boon backfired, and she perished while Prahlad survived, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. This story is commemorated through Holika Dahan, a ritual bonfire.">
