    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Love, Jealousy, and Deadly Deeds in Uttar Pradesh</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh has seen a surge in murders motivated by extramarital affairs, with over half a dozen cases reported, including the recent murder of Saurabh Rajput in Meerut. A psychological expert attributes these crimes to increasing impulsiveness and the prioritization of emotions over logic, warning that jealousy and possessiveness are driving individuals to violence.  

The expert suggests measures like pre-marital counseling, open communication, and mutual respect to strengthen relationships and reduce such crimes.

One recent case involved Pragati Yadav, who allegedly conspired with her lover to murder her husband, Dilip, two weeks after their forced marriage.  CCTV footage led to the arrest of Pragati, her lover Anurag, and the alleged hitman Ramaji Chaudhary.">
