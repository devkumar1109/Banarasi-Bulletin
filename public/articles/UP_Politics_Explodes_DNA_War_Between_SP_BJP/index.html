    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Politics Explodes: DNA War Between SP, BJP</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A war of words erupted between UP Deputy CM Brajesh Pathak and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav over Pathak's claim that the SP's "DNA" is linked to "Muslim appeasement" and "mafia nexus." 

The SP's official X handle responded with a personal attack on Pathak, leading to an FIR and protests by BJP workers. Akhilesh assured that derogatory remarks from party members would cease, while Pathak insisted his comment targeted the SP's political ideology, not individuals.

Akhilesh countered, alleging that Pathak's statement hurt religious sentiments and claimed that neither Pathak nor his Brahmin community are favored by the UP government. 

This exchange comes amidst the SP's PDA (Pichhda, Dalit, Alpsankhyak) campaign, targeting Dalits, and Akhilesh's outreach to the Brahmin community.">
