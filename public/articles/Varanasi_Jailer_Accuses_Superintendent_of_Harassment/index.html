    <meta name="description" content="A woman deputy jailer in Varanasi, Meena Kanojia, has accused jail superintendent Umesh Singh of harassment.  She alleges the harassment escalated after she refused his request to visit his home and that he publicly taunted her. Kanojia claims she filed a complaint with the DG (prison) four months ago detailing the harassment and corruption within the jail but received no response. Following the viral video of her allegations, Kanojia was transferred to Naini jail.  The UP Congress Committee president criticized the transfer, calling it a failure of women empowerment claims. The DIG (prison) and the superintendent are under investigation, with further action pending the outcome.">
