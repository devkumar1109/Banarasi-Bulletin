    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Historian Arrested Over Women Officers' Press Briefing</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Historian and Ashoka University professor Ali Khan Mahmudabad was arrested on May 18th for a social media post questioning the optics of women officers addressing a press briefing after Operation Sindoor.  

Mahmudabad's arrest sparked national debate on free speech, with sharp reactions from Uttar Pradesh's political circles. A complaint filed by BJP Yuva Morcha alleged the post was "anti-national" and "demeaning to India's armed forces."

The post, published on Facebook, reportedly questioned the representational intent behind showcasing women officers after the operation and whether their presence signified a genuine shift or was merely symbolic. The Haryana State Commission for Women took suo motu cognisance of the post.

Mahmudabad was booked under Section 152 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) - a new provision replacing sedition - and charges related to outraging religious sentiments. His legal team, led by Kapil Sibal, approached the Supreme Court seeking immediate relief, which will be heard on May 20th or 21st.">
