    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - ASHAs Strike: India's Health Heroes Demand Justice</title>
    <meta name="description" content="India's Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), essential to the nation's healthcare system, are demanding better wages, secure employment, and social benefits. Despite their crucial role in connecting rural and urban communities with healthcare services, ASHAs are underpaid and overworked, leading to recent state-wide strikes in Kerala, Karnataka, Bihar, and Maharashtra. 

Launched in 2005, the ASHA program trains women health activists to provide primary healthcare at the grassroots level. ASHAs are guided by Auxiliary Nurse Midwives and health officers and have been recognized for their contributions to reducing maternal and infant mortality, as well as their role in the COVID-19 response. 

In 2022, ASHAs received the WHO Global Health Leaders’ Award, highlighting their importance.  However, they often face financial insecurity despite exceeding their official work hours and managing responsibilities like home visits, maternal and newborn care, and child immunizations.">
