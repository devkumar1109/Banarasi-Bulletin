    <meta name="description" content="EKI Energy Services Ltd has been appointed as the carbon consultant for the Varanasi Smart City Bio-Conversion Project. The project, located in Shahanshahpur, processes 70 tonnes of animal manure and organic feedstock daily through anaerobic digestion. It generates 2,500-2,800 kg/day of compressed biogas (CBG) and by-products like fermented organic manure and liquid organic manure. 

The project is expected to reduce 33,187 tonnes of CO₂e emissions over seven years and has already avoided 2,806 tonnes during its first monitoring period. Supported by the Adani Group, Gobardhan Varanasi Foundation SPV, and local authorities, the project creates over 25 jobs and aligns with India's climate goals by reducing chemical fertilizer use and promoting sustainable farming practices.">
