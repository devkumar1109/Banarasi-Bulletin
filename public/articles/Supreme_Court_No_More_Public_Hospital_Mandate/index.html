    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Supreme Court: No More Public Hospital Mandate</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Supreme Court overturned a 2018 Allahabad High Court order requiring Uttar Pradesh government officials to use only public hospitals.  The High Court had issued the directive as part of a larger effort to improve government healthcare. 

The Supreme Court ruled that such directives interfere with policy decisions and limit individual choice in medical treatment.  The Court questioned the rationale behind restricting treatment options for government officials and expressed concern about potential inequities in healthcare access.  

The Supreme Court judgment upheld the right of individuals to choose their healthcare providers and affirmed the executive branch's authority in formulating healthcare policy.  The judgment allows petitioners to file new petitions with specific data and facts before the High Court.">
