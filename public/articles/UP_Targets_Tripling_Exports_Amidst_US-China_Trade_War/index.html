    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Targets Tripling Exports Amidst US-China Trade War</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The UP government is preparing a new export policy to leverage the US-China tariff war, focusing on its robust MSME sector.  UP boasts 96 lakh MSME units, the highest in India, and is the country's fourth largest exporter.  The state aims to increase exports by promoting its products, particularly carpets, leather goods, handicrafts, and processed meats, through international trade shows and heavy advertising campaigns.  An export promotion fund will be established to support this initiative.  Additionally, a dedicated leather and footwear export policy is in development, similar to Tamil Nadu's, to boost exports from Kanpur, Unnao, and Agra. The One District One Product Scheme, launched in 2018, has significantly increased UP's exports, and the government aims to triple them by 2030.">
