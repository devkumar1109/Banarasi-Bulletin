    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BJP Picks New UP District Presidents Online</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The BJP will announce new district presidents for Uttar Pradesh online for the first time, using live streaming and WhatsApp. 

The announcement will be made on Sunday, with 87 out of 98 districts expected to be filled.  

A task center at the party headquarters in Lucknow will monitor the process, with IT cell handling online monitoring in each district. District election officers will receive the names via WhatsApp and announce them at meetings attended by local leaders and elected representatives.  

Around 50% of the district president positions are expected to be filled by OBCs, SCs/STs, and women, a move aimed at countering the SP's "PDA" (Pichhda, Dalit, and Alpsankhyak) slogan.  The BJP anticipates protests from disappointed candidates, as over 50 nominations were filed for each organizational election.">
