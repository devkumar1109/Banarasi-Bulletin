    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT-BHU's Drowning Detection: Life-Saving Tech Takes Splash</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Researchers at IIT-BHU have developed a portable drowning monitoring system. 

The device uses real-time sensors and data analytics to detect early signs of drowning, such as changes in heart rate, location, and depth. 

It sends instant alerts to nearby responders or mobile devices, enabling rapid rescue. 

The system also stores user health data, providing insights for long-term safety.

IIT-BHU has patented the technology and is conducting commercial trials, aiming for large-scale deployment. This innovation aligns with the Make in India initiative and has the potential to significantly improve safety for swimmers and fishermen, especially in challenging conditions.">
