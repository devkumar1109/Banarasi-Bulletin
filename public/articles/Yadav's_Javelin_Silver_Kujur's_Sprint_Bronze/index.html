    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Yadav's Javelin Silver, Kujur's Sprint Bronze</title>
    <meta name="description" content="At the Asian Athletics Championships, India's Sachin Yadav won a silver medal in javelin throw with a personal best of 85.16m, narrowly missing the World Championships qualifying mark. Pakistan's Arshad Nadeem, the reigning Olympic champion, took gold with a 86.40m throw. 

Yadav attributed his performance to twin injuries, hindering his training. Despite the setback, he remains hopeful of qualifying for the World Championships in Tokyo. Fellow Indian javelin thrower Yashvir Singh also achieved a personal best of 82.57m, securing fifth place. 

India's first medal of the day came from sprinter Rajesh Kujur, who won bronze in the men's 200m with a national record time of 20.32 seconds, ending a decade-long wait for an Indian medal in the event.">
