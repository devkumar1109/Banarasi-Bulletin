    <meta name="description" content="Researchers at IIT-BHU have developed Potassium Ferric Oxalate Nanoparticle (KFeOx-NPs) to prevent blood clotting and thrombosis. This novel material effectively prevents clotting for up to 48 hours without affecting blood cell structure. 

KFeOx-NPs offer a safer alternative to conventional anticoagulants like warfarin and heparin, which can cause side effects like excessive bleeding and bone density reduction. 

The material's efficacy was tested on human blood samples and a mouse model, demonstrating its ability to prevent clot formation. The findings were published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, and a patent has been filed for the nanomaterial.">
