    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Modi 3.0: Alliances, Diplomacy, and a New Mandate</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Narendra Modi enters his second year of his third term as Prime Minister with a focus on alliances. Despite the BJP securing only 240 seats in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Modi has found support from NDA allies like Chandrababu Naidu, Nitish Kumar, and Chirag Paswan.  The BJP is showing flexibility by letting Nitish Kumar lead the party in the upcoming Bihar elections.

The RSS, despite initial reservations about the BJP's performance in the 2024 elections, has rallied behind Modi and actively campaigned for the party in subsequent state elections. 

The Pahalgam terror attack and the subsequent ceasefire with Pakistan have been defining moments for Modi 3.0. The ceasefire, brokered by Donald Trump, drew criticism from the right wing, but the BJP leadership has chosen a diplomatic approach.">
