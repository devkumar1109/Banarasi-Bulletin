    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Faith, Tech, and Innovation Drive UP's Startup Boom</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath addressed a unicorn conclave in Agra, emphasizing the synergy between faith, technology, and innovation.  He likened the exchange of ideas among entrepreneurs to the creation of the Ramayan, where Valmiki sought guidance from Narada. Adityanath highlighted the success of the 'Khoya-Paya' initiative during the Maha Kumbh, which reunited 28,000 missing individuals using technology. He asserted that UP, with over 14,000 startups, is poised to achieve a trillion-dollar economy.  The CM cited the example of five women from Bundelkhand who, after receiving training from the government, established a successful milk producers' network with a Rs 1,500 crore turnover and 42,000 women beneficiaries.">
