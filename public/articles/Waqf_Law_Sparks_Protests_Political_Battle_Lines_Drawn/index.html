    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Waqf Law Sparks Protests, Political Battle Lines Drawn</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Protests are erupting across India against a new law concerning Waqf properties. 

A Congress leader has challenged the law in the Supreme Court, and various political parties are capitalizing on the protests for electoral gains. Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh and Vijay in Tamil Nadu are among those who have joined the demonstrations. 

The Waqf bill is particularly contentious in states with large Muslim populations, including Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar, all set to have elections in the coming years.

Opposition parties, such as the RJD, Congress, and Left parties, are hoping to secure Muslim votes by opposing the bill. 

However, the protests could potentially benefit the BJP, which has garnered support from anti-Muslim voters in the past.  Internal strife within Bihar's ruling JDU and the entry of Prashant Kishor into the political fray further complicate the situation.">
