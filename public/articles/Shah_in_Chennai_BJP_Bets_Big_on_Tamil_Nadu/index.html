    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Shah in Chennai: BJP Bets Big on Tamil Nadu</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Union Home Minister Amit Shah's visit to Chennai is crucial for the BJP's electoral prospects in Tamil Nadu ahead of next year's Assembly elections.  Shah is expected to continue alliance talks with the AIADMK, which has set conditions for rejoining the NDA, including choosing the Chief Ministerial candidate and final decisions regarding the alliance.  

Shah's visit comes amidst political developments in the BJP's ally PMK, where S Ramadoss replaced his son Anbumani Ramadoss as president. The BJP faces a challenge in South India, with Tamil Nadu being a key battleground against the DMK's strong presence. Shah's interactions with state BJP functionaries and RSS ideologue S Gurumurthy will be closely watched.">
