The incident occurred late on Monday night after Ramesh, a mason, reportedly mentioned the name of Lord Hanuman's mother, Anjani, which Subhash took as a personal insult.  

The brothers, reportedly fueled by alcohol, began fighting with Ramesh, beating him with sticks. Other family members eventually intervened, taking Ramesh to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. Police have arrested the three suspects and sent Ramesh's body for a postmortem examination.">
