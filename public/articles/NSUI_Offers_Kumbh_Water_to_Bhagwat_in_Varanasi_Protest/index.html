    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - NSUI Offers Kumbh Water to Bhagwat in Varanasi Protest</title>
    <meta name="description" content="NSUI activists protested against RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat in Varanasi, attempting to block his convoy and offer him Maha Kumbh Sangam water.  The activists, led by Vikas Singh, shouted slogans while Bhagwat's convoy passed through Sigra. Police intervened, detaining several NSUI members.

The activists criticized Bhagwat for not participating in the Maha Kumbh, claiming he engages in "politics of Hindutva" but avoids its practice. They intended to offer the holy water as a reminder that Hindutva represents faith and tradition, symbolized by the millions who took a dip at Maha Kumbh.">
