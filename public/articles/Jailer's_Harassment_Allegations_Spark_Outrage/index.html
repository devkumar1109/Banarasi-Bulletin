    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Jailer's Harassment Allegations Spark Outrage</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A woman deputy jailer in Varanasi, Meena Kanojia, accused jail superintendent Umesh Singh of harassment.  She alleged the harassment escalated after she refused his request to visit his home. Kanojia claimed Singh publicly taunted her and used obscene language.  She filed a complaint with the DG (prison) four months ago detailing the harassment and alleged corruption within the jail, but received no response.  

Following the viral video of Kanojia's allegations, a transfer order surfaced online, sending her to Naini jail in Prayagraj. UP Congress Committee president Ajay Rai criticized the transfer, calling it a failure to empower women and a lack of action against the accused superintendent.  Officials at prison headquarters confirmed investigations are underway against both Kanojia and Singh, and further action will be taken based on the findings.">
