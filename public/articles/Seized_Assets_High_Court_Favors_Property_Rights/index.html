    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Seized Assets: High Court Favors Property Rights</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Allahabad High Court ruled that property seized in investigations must be released to the rightful owner if it's not needed for the trial's conclusion. Justice Sanjay Kumar Pachori emphasized that property can't be taken without legal authority and the rightful owner should be determined based on the most likely evidence.  

The case involved Indian currency seized from Sachin Sharma. Waeem Riaz claimed ownership and applied for its release under Cr.P.C sections 457 and 451. Initial applications were rejected, but Riaz challenged the orders in higher courts. The Allahabad High Court ultimately sided with Riaz, highlighting that if the seized property isn't crucial for the trial's progress, it should be returned to its rightful owner.">
