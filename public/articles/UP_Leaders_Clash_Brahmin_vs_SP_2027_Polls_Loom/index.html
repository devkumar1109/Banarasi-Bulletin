    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Leaders Clash: Brahmin vs. SP, 2027 Polls Loom</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The conflict between Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Brajesh Pathak and Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav escalated after the SP's official X handle criticized Pathak. Pathak had accused the SP's "DNA" of being linked to "Muslim appeasement" and "mafia nexus."  An FIR was filed against the SP's X handler. Akhilesh assured that derogatory remarks would cease from his party, but Pathak continued his attacks, alleging the SP's politics were based on casteism and appeasement.  Akhilesh countered by advising Pathak to focus on his "political health" and claimed that Pathak and his Brahmin community were disliked by those in power. This exchange highlights the BJP and SP's efforts to woo different social groups ahead of the 2027 UP Assembly polls.">
