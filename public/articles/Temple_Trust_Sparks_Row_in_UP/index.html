    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Temple Trust Sparks Row in UP</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh government has constituted a trust to manage the administration of the Banke Bihari temple in Mathura as part of its plan to redevelop the Banke Bihari corridor. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav criticized the move, alleging the BJP is attempting to control temples under the guise of better administration. 

The Department of Religious Affairs, responsible for developing religious institutions and temples in UP, was revived by Akhilesh Yadav during his tenure as CM.  Since 2017, under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the department has gained prominence, collaborating with the Tourism Department to promote religious tourism. 

Adityanath has established several "parishads" for developing temple and pilgrimage sites across the state, with the Braj Teerth Vikas Parishad being fully operational. The government has also increased financial assistance for pilgrims undertaking the Kailash Mansarovar and Sindhu Darshan Yatras.">
