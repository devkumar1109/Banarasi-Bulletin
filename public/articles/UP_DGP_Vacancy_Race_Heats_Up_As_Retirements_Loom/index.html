    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - U.P. DGP Vacancy: Race Heats Up As Retirements Loom</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh DGP Prashant Kumar retires on May 31st, leaving the post vacant.  The government is deciding whether to appoint his successor based on new cabinet rules or a panel sent to the UPSC. No panel has been sent yet, and the DGP selection committee formation under the new rules is pending.  

Senior IPS officers are considered potential successors, with frontrunners including Sandeep Salunke, Daljit Singh Chaudhary, and Renuka Mishra.  Other candidates include MK Bashal, Tilottama Verma, and Alok Sharma.  Three DG-rank officers, including Kumar, retiring in May will likely cause a major shift in the IPS seniority list, potentially elevating the frontrunners. There's also speculation about Kumar receiving a three-month service extension.">
