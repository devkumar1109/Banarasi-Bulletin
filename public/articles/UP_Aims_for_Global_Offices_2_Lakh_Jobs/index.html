    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Aims for Global Offices, 2 Lakh Jobs</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh's new Global Capability Centres (GCC) policy aims to establish the state as a major office space hub, creating over 2 lakh high-paying jobs in five years.  The policy offers significant subsidies: 30-50% on land costs, 25% capital subsidy (up to Rs 10 crore for Level-1 GCCs and Rs 25 crore for advanced ones), and 100% stamp duty exemption. Incentives will be performance-based, focusing on job creation, export growth, and technology innovation.  

The policy categorizes GCCs into Level 1 (minimum investment of Rs 15-20 crore or 100-200 employees) and Advanced GCCs.  Industry experts believe the policy will accelerate corporate leasing driven by a skilled workforce, improved infrastructure, and the development of commercial complexes.">
