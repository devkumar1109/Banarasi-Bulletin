    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - SP Fires Up Dalit Vote, Challenges BJP, BSP</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Samajwadi Party (SP) is strategically shifting its focus toward the Dalit community in Uttar Pradesh.  This move is evident in recent fiery statements made by SP's Dalit leaders, which the party has chosen to endorse rather than condemn. This assertive stance suggests a calculated effort by the SP to position itself as the primary challenger to the BJP in the state.  The SP's approach is seen as a direct challenge to both the BJP and BSP, who also vie for the Dalit vote.  This deliberate provocation in the politically charged environment of Uttar Pradesh is likely to have a significant impact on the state's electoral landscape.">
