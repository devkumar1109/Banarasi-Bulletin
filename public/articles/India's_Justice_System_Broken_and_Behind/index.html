    <meta name="description" content="The India Justice Report 2025 reveals significant flaws in India's justice system. Key findings include:

* **Underfunding and Staffing Shortages:** Police training receives only 1.25% of budgets, forensic science is understaffed, and prisons are overcrowded. 
* **Gender Inequality:** No state meets its reserved quotas for women in police forces.
* **Overburdened Judiciary:** Over 5 crore cases are pending across courts, with only 4% initiated suo motu.
* **Declining Legal Aid:** Paralegal volunteers have decreased since 2019, limiting access to legal advice, especially in rural areas. 
* **Slow Pace of Reform:** Despite some progress in areas like digital infrastructure and women in the judiciary, the overall picture is one of systemic neglect.
