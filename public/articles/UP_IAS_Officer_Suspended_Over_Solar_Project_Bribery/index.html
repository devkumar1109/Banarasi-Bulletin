    <meta name="description" content="Abhishek Prakash, a 2006 batch IAS officer and IIT Roorkee alumnus, has been suspended by the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh. The suspension follows a complaint alleging Prakash demanded a 5% commission for approving a solar project.

CM Yogi has vowed to crack down on corruption, with this case adding to several ongoing investigations against IAS and PCS officers in the state.  Seven suspended officers, including Ghanshyam Singh, were recently given new postings.
