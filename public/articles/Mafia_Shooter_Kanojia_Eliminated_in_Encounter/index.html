    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Mafia Shooter Kanojia Eliminated in Encounter</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Anuj Kanojia, a sharp shooter for mafia don Mukhtar Ansari, was killed in an encounter with UPSTF and Jharkhand police in Jamshedpur. Kanojia's elimination came a day after the Ghazipur police increased the reward on his head to Rs 2.5 lakh.  

The news brought joy to the family of Manna Singh, a contractor murdered by Kanojia and Mukhtar's gang in 2009. Mukhtar Ansari died in jail last year, and his son Abbas Ansari was released on bail in March. 

Kanojia, known for his skills with firearms and role in Mukhtar's extortion and contract grabbing activities, even had his wife continue his criminal operations after pressure mounted on the gang. Mukhtar's wife, Afsha Ansari, remains absconding and is wanted by police.">
