    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Churchill Brothers Crowned I-League Champions</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The All India Football Federation (AIFF) upheld appeals from Namdhari FC, Real Kashmir, and Churchill Brothers against Inter Kashi regarding player Mario Barco's eligibility.  This decision deducts four points from Inter Kashi, adds two to Churchill Brothers, and awards three to Namdhari. Churchill Brothers now have an unassailable lead with 42 points, securing them the I-League championship. Inter Kashi, dropping to 37 points, plans to appeal this decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for a second time.  The AIFF appeals committee rejected the league committee's earlier ruling, stating it couldn't make an ineligible player eligible. The I-League officially concluded on March 31, and Churchill Brothers were initially declared champions on April 19, but Inter Kashi's appeal to CAS led to a stay on the AIFF's decision.">
