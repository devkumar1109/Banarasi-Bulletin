    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT Grad IAS Officer Suspended for Bribery Allegations</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Abhishek Prakash, a 2006 batch IAS officer and IIT Roorkee alumnus, has been suspended by the Uttar Pradesh government for allegedly demanding a commission for approving a solar project.  Prakash, who was Secretary, Industrial Development Department, and CEO of Invest UP, is accused of directing the complainant to contact a private individual who demanded a 5% commission. 

This action comes as part of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's strict stance against corruption in Uttar Pradesh, which has led to investigations and action against several IAS and PCS officers. Prakash, born in 1982, holds an Engineering degree from IIT Roorkee and a Master's degree in Public Administration and Public Policy.  He previously served as the District Magistrate of Lakhimpur Kheri and Lucknow.">
