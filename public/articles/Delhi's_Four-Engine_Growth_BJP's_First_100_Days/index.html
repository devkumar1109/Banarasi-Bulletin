    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Delhi's Four-Engine Growth: BJP's First 100 Days</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The BJP-led Delhi government, in its first 100 days, has made significant strides in development initiatives, aided by close coordination with central ministries and Lt.-Governor V K Saxena. This progress is attributed to the BJP's control at four levels: Centre, State, and both municipal corporations, enabling a "four-engine" governance model. 

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is personally involved in Delhi's development agenda, aiming to transform it into a "world-class capital." A core group of handpicked bureaucrats across city and central departments, known for delivering "visible and tangible change," plays a crucial role. Recent reshuffles involving over 50 IAS, IPS, and DANICS officials have strengthened this network. 

Notable appointments include Kaushal Raj Sharma, a 2006-batch IAS officer with experience in PM Modi's constituency, as the CEO of the Delhi Jal Board.  Three senior IAS officers with significant central tenures were also appointed to key positions in the Chief Minister's Office.">
