Kashyap claims her daughter was beaten by the principal, but Karal denies this, stating Himanshi already had weak eyesight.  She says the injury occurred when a classmate accidentally hit Himanshi's eye with her elbow. 

Kashyap's request for a medical certificate was denied, leading to an alleged threat towards the principal. Moradabad Basic Siksha Adhikari (BSA) Ajit Kumar has initiated an inquiry into the incident.">
