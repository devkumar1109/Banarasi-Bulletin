    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi's Kimami Sewai: A Culinary Bridge</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Varanasi, Hindu artisans have been manufacturing 'kimami' sewai (vermicelli) for generations, making it a beloved Eid specialty.  This tradition reflects deep cultural integration in the city.

The premium, thin sewai is highly sought after during Eid, while the thicker 'soot-pheni' is popular for 'sehri' during Ramadan.  

Around 200 families, involving 2,000 people, are engaged in this industry, primarily located in the 'sewai mandi' (wholesale market).  Production increases significantly two to three months before Ramadan.

Banarasi sewai is exported to other countries, with its unique thin varieties (size 1, size 2, and size 0) made with refined flour and ghee, setting it apart from other vermicelli.  Sales peak during Eid, but the sewai is also popular during Holi and Bakrid.">
