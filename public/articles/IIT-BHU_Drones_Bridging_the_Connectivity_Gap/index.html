    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT-BHU Drones: Bridging the Connectivity Gap</title>
    <meta name="description" content="IIT-BHU, Varanasi has developed a drone-based communication system that allows for image and message sharing without internet connectivity and over vast distances. 

The system, called dedicated self-sustaining transmission mechanism (SSTM), uses autonomous drones to relay data, enabling real-time communication even in remote or signal-blocked areas. 

Led by Prof. Hari Prabhat Gupta, the system was tested in challenging conditions and is designed for applications like defense, border surveillance, disaster response, and emergency rescue.  

The drones form a dynamic mesh network adapting to terrain and movement.  Future developments include integrating AI for path optimization and encryption for secure transmissions.">
