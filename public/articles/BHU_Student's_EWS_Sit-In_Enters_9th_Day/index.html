    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BHU Student's EWS Sit-In Enters 9th Day</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Archita Singh, a postgraduate student, has been staging an indefinite sit-in at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) for over eight days demanding admission to the PhD (Hindi) program under the EWS quota.  She claims her EWS certificate is valid but the university administration is hindering her admission.  

Archita alleges that despite providing necessary documents and an undertaking, the university did not send her the admission link. She has received support from various political parties and caste-based organizations. After protesting for 15 days, she started her sit-in, even being hospitalized briefly due to dehydration.  

BHU officials have formed a committee to investigate if any admissions were made based on conditional certificates and are awaiting their report.">
