    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Ambedkar Poster: UP Politics Ignites</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A poster featuring the faces of Akhilesh Yadav and B.R. Ambedkar has sparked controversy in Uttar Pradesh. The poster, displayed outside the Samajwadi Party (SP) office in Lucknow, has been condemned by the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), with Mayawati demanding an apology from Yadav. The BJP staged protests against the poster, accusing the SP of disrespecting Ambedkar. The SP distanced itself from the poster, suggesting it might be the work of BJP supporters.  The controversy comes amidst the SP's efforts to woo Dalit and OBC voters, key constituencies for the BJP.  The SP's recent success in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, where it secured a seat in Ayodhya, has intensified the political competition in the state.">
