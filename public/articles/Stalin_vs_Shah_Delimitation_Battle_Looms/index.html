    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Stalin vs Shah: Delimitation Battle Looms</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin criticized the upcoming Lok Sabha delimitation exercise based on the 2026 Census, claiming it will reduce the state's representation in Parliament. He argues that using population as a yardstick is flawed, especially since Southern states like Tamil Nadu have controlled population growth.  

Union Home Minister Amit Shah, however, reassured South India that the Prime Minister will ensure a fair share of seats for the region during delimitation. Shah's statement at the inauguration of the BJP office in Coimbatore contradicts Stalin's claims of Southern states' representation being suppressed.
