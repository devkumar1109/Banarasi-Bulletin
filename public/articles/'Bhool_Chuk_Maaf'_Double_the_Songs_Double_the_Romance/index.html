    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - 'Bhool Chuk Maaf': Double the Songs, Double the Romance</title>
    <meta name="description" content="'Bhool Chuk Maaf', starring Rajkummar Rao and Wamiqa Gabbi, has been pushed to a May 9 release.  Two new songs are being added to the romantic comedy, one already filmed at a Mira Road studio, and another to be shot in Varanasi in mid-April. The Varanasi song will have a romantic bachelorette party vibe.  

Both songs are choreographed by Vijay Ganguly and designed by Sheetal Sharma, with Tanishk Bagchi composing the first peppy promotional number.  The film revolves around Rao's character who gets stuck in a time loop the day before his wedding.">
