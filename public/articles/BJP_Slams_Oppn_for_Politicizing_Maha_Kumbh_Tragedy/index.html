    <meta name="description" content="Here is a summary of the news in 150 words:

BJP spokesman Sudhanshu Trivedi accused the opposition of seeking political gain from the Maha Kumbh tragedy, where a stampede occurred. Trivedi targeted Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav for questioning the death toll, calling it an old habit of raising doubts. He also criticized other opposition leaders for their remarks, such as "Mrityu Kumbh", which he believes are part of a larger campaign to dismantle global Hinduism. Trivedi praised the successful organization of Maha Kumbh in UP, crediting PM Modi's government for boosting the region's economy and cultural awakening. He also took a jibe at the opposition over the issue of deporting illegal Indian immigrants by the US, accusing them of opposing India's efforts to tackle illegal immigration and seeing it as a vote bank.">
