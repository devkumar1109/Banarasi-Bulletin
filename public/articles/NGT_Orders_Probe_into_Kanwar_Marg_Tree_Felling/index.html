    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - NGT Orders Probe into Kanwar Marg Tree Felling</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered the Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary to investigate allegations of illegal tree felling for the 111-km Kanwar Marg project.  The Forest Survey of India (FSI) Joint Director reported to the NGT that trees were felled beyond the permitted 20-meter stretch in multiple locations, providing photographic evidence. 

An earlier joint committee, including FSI representatives, had submitted a report in January, but the FSI representatives did not sign it due to differing opinions. The NGT has allowed the FSI Joint Director to submit a separate report. The UP government argued that the FSI director was not directed to appoint a representative, but the NGT stated that the competence of the joint director is not the issue given the allegations of illegal tree felling.">
