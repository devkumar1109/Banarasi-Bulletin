    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - NGT Orders Probe into Kanwar Marg Tree Felling</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary to investigate allegations of illegal tree felling for the Kanwar Marg project. 

The FSI Joint Director reported that trees were felled beyond the permitted 20-meter stretch, citing photographs and satellite images. Though a joint committee previously investigated the matter, the FSI representatives did not sign the report due to these concerns.  

The NGT, acknowledging the seriousness of the allegations, has given the FSI Joint Director the liberty to submit a separate report. The UP government argued that the joint director lacked the authority to submit the report, but the NGT refuted this claim.">
