    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Rai's "Neebu-Mircha" Rafale Jibe Lands Him in FIR</title>
    <meta name="description" content="An FIR has been filed against UP Congress chief Ajay Rai for his "Neebu-Mircha" jibe on Rafale fighter jets.  

The complaint, filed by Pradeep Kumar Gupta of Rashtriya Hindu Shakti Vahini, alleges Rai's statement demoralized the army and incited communal tensions. Rai displayed a toy airplane with a "Neebu-Mircha" (lemon and chili) hanging from it, sarcastically referring to it as a Rafale and criticizing the government's preparedness. 

The BJP condemned Rai's remarks as an insult to the armed forces and accused the Congress party of attempting to demoralize them.  The FIR was registered under sections 191(1) and 353(2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita for assertions prejudicial to national integration and statements conducive to public mischief.">
