    <meta name="description" content="Varanasi's Division Commissioner S Rajalingam has directed officials to expedite the multi-modal terminal and freight village projects. 

The multi-modal terminal at Ramnagar will include a sewage treatment plant and a multimedia jetty, with vessels like MV Bengal Ganga and SL Jahnavi already docked there.

The freight village, spanning 100 acres on the Varanasi-Chandauli border, will be developed by NHLML into a state-of-the-art Multi-Modal Logistics Park (MMLP).  

It will be connected to NH-7, NH-2, a 5.1 km railway line to Jeevanathpur Junction, and the Ralhupur Multi-Modal Terminal, enabling a freight corridor from northeast to south India. 

This project aims to provide significant investment and employment opportunities.">
