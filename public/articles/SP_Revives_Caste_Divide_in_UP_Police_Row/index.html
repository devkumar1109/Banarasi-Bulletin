    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - SP Revives Caste Divide in UP Police Row</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Samajwadi Party (SP) is targeting Brahmin votes in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the 2026 Assembly elections, reviving the "Thakur versus Brahmin" narrative. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav alleged that the Yogi Adityanath government favors Thakurs in police postings, citing data from Agra, Mainpuri, Mahoba, and Prayagraj. He claimed that PDA communities, despite comprising 90% of the state's population, have only 25% representation in police posts. 

DGP Prashant Kumar called the allegations "baseless and misleading," while UP BJP president Bhupendra Singh Chaudhary refuted them, claiming the Adityanath government follows recruitment rules and not caste-based postings. Akhilesh countered the DGP's statement, urging the CM to address the issue.">
