    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - NRI's Bomb Scare Delays Varanasi Flight</title>
    <meta name="description" content="An NRI passenger, Nishant Yohanathan, caused panic at Varanasi Babatpur Airport by falsely claiming he had a bomb in his bag on an IndiGo flight to Bangalore on Saturday night.  The flight was isolated, passengers detained, and the passenger questioned. No suspicious items were found, but Yohanathan was taken for further questioning by the IB-LAU.  The flight eventually took off safely the next morning.  A Canadian passport was found on Yohanathan and he was handed over to Phulpur police. An FIR will be registered against him. Police and intelligence agencies are investigating the incident, considering it a serious offense.">
