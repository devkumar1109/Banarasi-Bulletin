    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BJP's "Reclaim and Reconnect" Dalit Outreach</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The BJP's strategy for the 2027 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections focuses on "reclaim and reconnect."  They aim to win back over 125 seats lost in 2022 and rebuild relationships with Dalit voters. A key initiative is the "Scheduled Caste Dialogue" campaign, involving grassroots meetings and public interactions led by state general secretary Dharampal Singh. This campaign aims to address misconceptions about the BJP's commitment to social justice and Dalit empowerment, particularly those spread by the SP-Congress alliance. The BJP's 2022 losses and the 2024 Lok Sabha election results have highlighted the need for course correction as the SP-Congress alliance gains traction among Dalit voters.">
