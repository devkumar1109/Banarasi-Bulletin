    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Modi's Sacred Gift: Varanasi Pot for Mauritian President</title>
    <meta name="description" content="During his visit to Mauritius, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gifted President Dharambeer Gokhiil a GI-tagged metal pot from Varanasi containing sacred Sangam water from Prayagraj. The pot, crafted by the Kasera community, is made of brass with a soldered copper band and is traditionally used to carry holy water. 

The gift holds significance as brass and copper are considered auspicious in Sanatan culture for storing sacred water. The Varanasi Metal Casting Craft, which includes intricate designs on metal surfaces, is a centuries-old tradition.  


Modi also presented a Surat Sadeli craft box, a Banaras sari, and Mithila makhana from Bihar, all bearing GI tags, to the Mauritian president.">
