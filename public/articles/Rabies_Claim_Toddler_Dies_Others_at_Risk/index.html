    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Rabies Claim: Toddler Dies, Others at Risk</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A three-year-old boy in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, died on Friday, suspected of rabies after being bitten by a rabid dog a month earlier.  Ten other children were also bitten by the same dog but did not receive medical attention.  

The boy's death triggered a local health emergency, with district health authorities launching a preventive campaign, including the distribution of anti-rabies vaccines. While the cause of death is yet to be medically confirmed as rabies due to lack of testing, the incident highlights the need for increased awareness and access to post-bite care in rural areas.  The Aligarh Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Neeraj Tyagi, assured that government hospitals have adequate vaccine supplies and urged the public to seek immediate medical attention after any animal bite.">
