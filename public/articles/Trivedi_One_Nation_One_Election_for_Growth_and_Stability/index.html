    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Trivedi: "One Nation, One Election" for Growth and Stability</title>
    <meta name="description" content="BJP Rajya Sabha MP Sudhanshu Trivedi advocated for "One Nation, One Election," stating it aligns with the original intent of the Constitution and promotes economic development and political stability. He argued that frequent elections disrupt governance and hinder long-term planning, citing the instability between 1989 and 2014. Trivedi emphasized the need for cooperation between the ruling party and the opposition, stating that "One Nation, One Election" would foster healthy politics and improve administrative efficiency. He highlighted the benefits of the system, including GDP savings exceeding 1%, decreased inflation rates, and an opportunity for collaborative work.  Trivedi also mentioned the success of the Modi government's Jan Dhan Yojana, which has empowered millions of citizens through direct benefit transfers.">
