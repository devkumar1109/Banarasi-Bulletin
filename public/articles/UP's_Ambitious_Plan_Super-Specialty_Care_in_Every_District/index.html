    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP's Ambitious Plan: Super-Specialty Care in Every District</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh government is launching a new five-year health policy to establish private super-specialty hospitals in every district. These hospitals will focus on heart, kidney, brain, and cancer treatment, improving access to quality care. 

The policy aims to attract private investment with incentives like land purchase benefits, affordable land rates, and expedited clearances.  

Hospitals will be categorized into three models:

* **Model A:** 200-bed hospitals in 17 municipal corporations, offering a wide range of specialities.
* **Model B:** 200-bed hospitals in 57 district headquarters, providing similar services to Model A.
* **Model C:** 100-bed hospitals in all 75 districts, focusing on general medicine, basic surgery, and maternal care. 

Investors in rural areas, particularly aspirational districts and Bundelkhand, will receive higher concessions.">
