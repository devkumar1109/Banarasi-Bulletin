    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - U.P. Turns Waste to Wings: Bio-Jet Fuel Policy</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh launched India's first bio-jet fuel policy, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Manufacturing Promotion Policy-2025, aiming to convert agricultural waste into bio-fuel. This policy is expected to benefit 2.5 crore farmers by creating a new market for residues like sugarcane bagasse and paddy husk. 

The policy offers incentives including capital subsidies, GST reimbursement, and land fee waivers to attract investment. Over 18 companies, including Greenko and AM Greens, have expressed interest in investing over ₹3,000 crore in the state's bio-jet fuel sector.

The initiative aligns with India's decarbonization goals and aims to contribute to climate objectives while enhancing energy security and creating green jobs.  Uttar Pradesh's robust infrastructure and logistics network make it an ideal location for SAF production.">
