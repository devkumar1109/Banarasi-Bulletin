    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) arrested Mohammad Tufail in Varanasi for suspected ties to Pakistan and spreading extremist propaganda among Muslim youth. Tufail allegedly communicated with individuals in Pakistan and disseminated provocative religious content, including videos of radical preacher Maulana Saad Rizvi and inflammatory statements about the Babri Masjid demolition. Over 800 phone numbers connected to WhatsApp groups run by Tufail are under surveillance. The ATS believes Tufail emotionally influenced young Muslims, promoting Sharia law as the basis for governance in both Pakistan and India.  Tufail reportedly created new WhatsApp groups after secret meetings and religious gatherings in Kannauj and Sirhind.  The ATS is investigating his travel history and expects further revelations.">
