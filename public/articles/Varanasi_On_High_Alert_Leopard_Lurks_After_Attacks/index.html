    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi On High Alert: Leopard Lurks After Attacks</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Following a leopard attack that injured three people in Varanasi last week, 12 villages along the Ganga river are on high alert. The leopard, suspected to have entered from Chandauli or the Kaimur Wildlife Sanctuary, has evaded capture despite search operations by joint forest teams from Varanasi and Chandauli. 

The injured are stable in the hospital. Though no confirmed sightings have occurred since Friday, officials believe the leopard may have moved out of the area.  Villagers are taking precautions, keeping night-long vigils and avoiding venturing out after dark. The forest department has deployed guards, installed nets and cages, and is conducting intensive combing operations.">
