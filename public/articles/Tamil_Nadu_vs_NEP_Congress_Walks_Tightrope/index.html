    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Tamil Nadu vs. NEP: Congress Walks Tightrope</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The "language war" between Tamil Nadu and the Centre over the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 presents a challenge for the Congress. 

Tamil Nadu, led by DMK, accuses the Centre of withholding funds and attempting to impose Hindi through the NEP's three-language formula.  The state, with a history of anti-Hindi agitations, prefers its existing two-language system (Tamil and English). 

Congress MP Manickam Tagore criticizes the Union Education Minister's statement and asserts the NEP should be implemented with "state's consent".  

However, Congress also needs to be careful not to be perceived as "anti-Hindi" as it caters to a diverse vote base, including Hindi-speaking states.">
