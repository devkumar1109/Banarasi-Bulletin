    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Stone-Pelting: Fear Grips Hindu Families</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Varanasi, a video of boys from a specific community throwing stones in the Kotwa area went viral, prompting a police investigation.  Around 15 Hindu families living in the area claim their houses were targeted with stones, leaving them fearful. The police are examining CCTV footage to determine the target of the boys' actions.  

Hindu families allege they are being targeted to force them out of the Muslim-dominated village. They cite the killing of Bhaiyalal Patel in February, where the accused belonged to the same community, as a reason for their fear. The families installed CCTV cameras after the incident, capturing the recent stone-pelting.  

Additionally, an elder claims a temple area was intentionally turned into a garbage dumping ground.">
