    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Police Fail Performance Test, Face Retraining</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Over 150 Varanasi police sub-inspectors were sidelined for retraining after failing a first-ever commissioner-led performance review. 107 sub-inspectors scored zero, over 50 couldn't draft basic FIRs, and many struggled with public grievances. 180 officers received disciplinary action, including removal from field duties. 

Despite 444 passing the review, only six were deemed "star performers." The commissioner highlighted the importance of skill, sensitivity, and seriousness in policing.  

Retraining involves rigorous physical drills, legal education, FIR writing, investigation techniques, and public interaction protocols.  

A comprehensive schedule includes daily 6 am parades, physical exercises, classroom sessions on CM Dashboard handling, IGRS disposal, and new criminal laws like the BNS. Four IPS officers and multiple ASPs and ACPs are instructors.">
