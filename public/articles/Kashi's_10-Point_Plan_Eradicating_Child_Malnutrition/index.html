    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Kashi's 10-Point Plan: Eradicating Child Malnutrition</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, a "10-Point Kashi Strategy" implemented by IAS officers S Rajalingam and Himanshu Nagpal has significantly reduced malnutrition in children.  The strategy focused on renovating Anganwadi centers, improving nutritional supplementation, and establishing Mini Nutritional Rehabilitation Centres. 

Initiatives included renovating 2,200 Anganwadi centers and building 600 new ones, providing daily iron and multivitamin supplements, and offering millet-based supplements and fortified foods. These efforts have reduced severe acute malnutrition (SAM) from 24,820 to 316 children in just three years.  Vartika, a two-year-old who was severely malnourished, is an example of the strategy's success. After receiving treatment at a Mini NRC, she regained her health and vitality.">
