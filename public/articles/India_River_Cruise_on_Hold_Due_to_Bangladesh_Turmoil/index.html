    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - India River Cruise on Hold Due to Bangladesh Turmoil</title>
    <meta name="description" content="India has postponed the world's longest river cruise from Varanasi to Dibrugarh via Dhaka due to political instability in Bangladesh following the ousting of the Sheikh Hasina government last August.  

Adverse travel advisories have discouraged foreign tourists, the primary target audience for the cruise.  The 3,200-km route, which connects Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, and Assam via Bangladesh, has seen reduced interest since its launch in January 2023.

While cargo movement along the India-Bangladesh Protocol (IBP) route continues, passenger services are currently suspended. Cruise operators anticipate resuming the service after elections and political stability are restored in Bangladesh.">
