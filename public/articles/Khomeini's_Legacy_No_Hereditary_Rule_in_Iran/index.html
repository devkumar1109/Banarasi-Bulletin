    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Khomeini's Legacy: No Hereditary Rule in Iran</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's first Supreme Leader, had a connection to Uttar Pradesh. His grandfather, Ahmad Hindi, was born near Barabanki.

This stance is recorded in his writings,  "Sahifeyeh Imam Khomeini."  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the current Supreme Leader, also shares this view.  

Although Mojtaba, Khamenei's son, is seen as a potential successor by some, Iran's system prevents hereditary rule due to its incompatibility with Islamic principles as defined by Khomeini.">
