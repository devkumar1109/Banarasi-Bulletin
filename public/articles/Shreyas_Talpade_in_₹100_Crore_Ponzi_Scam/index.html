    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Shreyas Talpade in ₹100 Crore Ponzi Scam</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Bollywood actor Shreyas Talpade has been accused in a Rs 100 crore ponzi scam in Uttar Pradesh's Mahoba district.  Talpade and 14 others allegedly ran a chit fund scheme, 'The Loni Urban Multistate Credit and Thrift Cooperative Society Limited,'  that promised high returns to rural investors.  Hundreds of villagers invested substantial sums, but the company abruptly ceased operations and its representatives disappeared after collecting crores.  

This is not Talpade's first legal entanglement. In February, he and actor Alok Nath were accused of defrauding investors of over ₹9 crore in Uttar Pradesh. They are also implicated in a multi-level marketing scam in Haryana.  

The Loni Urban Multi-State Credit and Thrift Cooperative Society has been under scrutiny for similar fraudulent activities in Uttarakhand, where it allegedly operated 35 unauthorized branches, defrauding investors of ₹92 crore.">
