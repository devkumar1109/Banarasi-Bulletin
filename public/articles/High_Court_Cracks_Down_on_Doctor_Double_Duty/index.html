    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - High Court Cracks Down on Doctor Double Duty</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Allahabad High Court has ordered the Uttar Pradesh government to take action against doctors in government hospitals and medical colleges found engaging in private practice.  

The court, previously expressing concern over doctors neglecting patients in public facilities, directed the government to formulate a policy prohibiting private practice by these doctors.

The court reviewed a report from 37 district magistrates regarding doctors involved in private practice, but found it lacking in details about disciplinary actions taken against them.  

The High Court has set March 26 as the date for further hearing, urging the government to expedite disciplinary proceedings and deter doctors from private practice.">
