    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Kumbh Mela Stampede: Blame Game Erupts</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Thirty people died in a stampede at the Maha Kumbh Mela. Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath defended the state's arrangements, accusing the previous Samajwadi Party government of neglect. He also criticized opposition parties for questioning the government, saying "vultures got only dead bodies. Pigs got dirt."

Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav countered Adityanath's remarks, condemning his choice of words and calling them inappropriate for a sacred event. Yadav accused the current government of exploiting the Kumbh for political gain and self-promotion, losing their morality and sensitivity in the process. He urged people to respond with sympathy rather than anger towards such individuals.">
