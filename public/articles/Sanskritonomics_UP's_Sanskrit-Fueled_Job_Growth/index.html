    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Sanskritonomics: UP's Sanskrit-Fueled Job Growth</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Following the success of the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025, the Uttar Pradesh government is focusing on "Sanskritonomics", a concept combining Sanskrit learning with job-oriented education.  

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's initiatives have led to the establishment of 73 new Sanskrit colleges, bringing the total to 184 institutions offering diploma-level Sanskrit courses. The Uttar Pradesh Secondary Sanskrit Education Council has also introduced four new diploma courses designed to connect students with job opportunities.

The state government believes Sanskrit education will provide modern employment prospects and benefit the youth. Shiv Lal, Secretary of the Secondary Sanskrit Education Council, claims the government's efforts are leading to increased employment opportunities in Sanskrit-led economic growth.  The National Education Policy 2020 further supports this initiative by providing opportunities for over 54 lakh children across 27,000 schools.">
