    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BHU Trauma Center:  FIRs Flare, Protests Quiet</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Infighting at BHU's trauma center has led to two FIRs lodged in a week.  Dr. Manjari Mishra filed an FIR against Prof. Saurabh Singh and two bouncers on June 12.  This follows an earlier FIR filed by Lanka police against her husband, Prof. Shashi Prakash Mishra, and Dr. Vishwambhar Singh, based on a complaint by Kamlesh Kumar Gond, a BHU trauma center employee. Gond alleged caste-based slurs and indecent behavior from Mishra.  Despite initial inaction, the court intervened, leading to the registration of Gond's FIR on June 12. Late that same night, Lanka police filed a case against Prof. Singh and two bouncers for sexual harassment, misconduct, and intimidation.  Several former student leaders had also joined the protests against corruption and other issues at BHU, but the situation has calmed following the FIRs.">
