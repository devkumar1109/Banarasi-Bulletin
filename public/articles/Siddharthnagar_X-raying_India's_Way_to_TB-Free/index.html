    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Siddharthnagar: X-raying India's Way to TB-Free</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Siddharthnagar, Uttar Pradesh, is leading the fight against tuberculosis in India by implementing a new strategy for early detection. The district utilizes ultraportable X-ray devices for door-to-door screening of high-risk populations, including diabetics, smokers, and those with HIV. This approach has identified 2,343 new tuberculosis patients in the early stages of the disease.

As part of the 100-day Intensified TB-Mukt Bharat Abhiyan, Siddharthnagar has established war rooms to monitor the campaign's progress. Over 216 gram panchayats have been declared TB-free, and diagnosed patients receive Ni-kshay Poshan kits for nutritional support. 

The district has also proactively put 21,165 individuals on TB preventive treatment. The Uttar Pradesh government, under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, aims to replicate Siddharthnagar's success across all 75 districts in the state.">
