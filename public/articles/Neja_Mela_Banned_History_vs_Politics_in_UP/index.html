    <meta name="description" content="The Sambhal administration in Uttar Pradesh has banned the annual Neja Mela, a fair commemorating Syed Salar Masud Ghazi, the nephew of Mahmud of Ghazni, a historical invader known for plundering Hindu temples. The decision was made citing objections from the Hindu community and concerns about public order.  ASP Shirish Chandra labelled celebrating an invader as inappropriate. Some analysts view this as a BJP move to counter the Samajwadi Party's focus on marginalized communities. The administration also sealed the traditional inauguration site, filling the ceremonial flagpole pit with cement.">
