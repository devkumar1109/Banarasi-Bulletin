    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Kumbh Mela Pollution: NGT Issues Notice to UP</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government and other authorities over poor sanitation at the Kumbh Mela, resulting in open defecation along the Ganga river.  

An application claimed that faecal coliform levels at the Triveni Sangam exceeded the permissible limit, making the water unfit for bathing.  

Water quality tests conducted in November 2024 revealed high levels of faecal coliform bacteria, exceeding the Environment Ministry's benchmark. The CPCB report submitted to the NGT on February 3 also confirmed that the Ganga's water quality did not meet the standards for bathing due to high faecal coliform levels.

The NGT has directed the authorities to respond before the next hearing scheduled for Monday.">
