    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Father Jailed for Daughter's Rape, Murder</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A man in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, has been sentenced to life in prison for raping his 14-year-old daughter and murdering both her and his wife in 2018. The court cited the gravity of the crime, stating that "a man under whose guardianship his own wife and daughter are not safe... how can anyone else in society feel safe living with him?" 

The case was cracked based on the testimony of the accused's 16-year-old son, who witnessed the abuse and reported it to his mother. Forensic analysis of obscene letters found at the crime scene confirmed the accused’s handwriting, despite his claims of illiteracy. The court convicted him under IPC sections 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 302 (murder), and 376 (rape), along with the POCSO Act, imposing a fine of Rs 28,000. 


The prosecution is seeking capital punishment and plans to appeal for an enhanced conviction in a higher court.">
