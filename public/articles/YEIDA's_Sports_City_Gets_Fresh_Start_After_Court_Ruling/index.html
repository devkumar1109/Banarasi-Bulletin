    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - YEIDA's Sports City Gets Fresh Start After Court Ruling</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) is signing fresh lease agreements with third-party developers for 13 Sports City projects. This follows a High Court ruling that allowed YEIDA to cancel the land allotment to Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) due to unpaid dues. 

The 13 projects involve 13,132 buyers across sectors 25 and 19. The court mandated that YEIDA execute new lease deeds, replacing JAL in previous agreements, and maintain the same terms and conditions for the sub-lessees.

YEIDA has identified 9,902 sanctioned flats and 3,230 residential plots in these projects. Developers have until June 21st to upload their documents, followed by homebuyers. The projects encompass various developments, including high-rise towers and villa plots. The ruling ends a five-year legal battle initiated by YEIDA in 2020.">
