    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi on High Alert: Leopard Lures Fear</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A leopard attack in Varanasi last week left three people injured and prompted a massive search operation. The leopard was last seen hiding in bushes on Friday but evaded capture despite attempts by forest officials to trap it.

Joint forest teams from Varanasi and Chandauli are conducting searches and advising villagers to remain vigilant. 12 villages along the Ganga river, with a combined population of 18,000, are on high alert, and villagers are taking precautions like night vigils and setting firecrackers to deter the animal.">
