    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Karnataka's Mega Projects Spark Environmental Backlash</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Karnataka's government is facing backlash for two proposed projects: a Rs 100 crore 'Cauvery Arati' at the KRS dam and a Rs 2,663 crore amusement park. Farmers and environmentalists criticize the projects, claiming they damage the dam's integrity, pollute the river, and threaten agricultural activities. 

Mysuru-Kodagu MP Yaduveer Wadiyar opposes the projects, citing environmental concerns and heritage preservation. He questions the Rs 100 crore budget for the 'arati' and argues that development should prioritize water security and community consultation. The amusement park, spanning 198 acres, would feature rides, a 350-foot statue of Goddess Cauvery, and a penguin habitat. 


Farmers urge the government to focus on desilting lakes and strengthening dams instead of commercial ventures they deem detrimental to nature. Deputy CM D.K. Shivakumar defends the projects.">
