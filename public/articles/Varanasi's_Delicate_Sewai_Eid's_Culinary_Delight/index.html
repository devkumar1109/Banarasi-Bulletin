    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi's Delicate Sewai: Eid's Culinary Delight</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Varanasi, Hindu artisans traditionally manufacture 'kimami' sewai, a specialized vermicelli, which is highly sought after during Eid celebrations. 

The thin, refined flour-based sewai, available in raw and cooked varieties, is a popular choice for 'sehri' (pre-dawn meal) during Ramadan and Eid feasts.  

Around 200 families in Varanasi engage in sewai production, with the industry witnessing a surge in activity two to three months before Ramadan.  

While the domestic market thrives on Banarasi sewai, exports also cater to international demand. 

The unique finesse and cleanliness of Varanasi's sewai, comparable to a strand of hair, make it a preferred choice across religious and cultural lines.">
