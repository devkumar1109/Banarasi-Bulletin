    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Contract Killing: 9 Arrested in TDP Leader's Murder</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Nine individuals have been arrested for the murder of Telugu Desam Party leader Muppavarapu Veeraiah Chowdary in Ongole, Prakasam district. The murder, which occurred on April 22, was a planned contract killing.  

Veeraiah was stabbed to death in his office by four assailants who escaped on a motorcycle and a scooter. Police recovered seven mobile phones, three knives, and a bag, along with two vehicles used in the crime.

The investigation revealed that Veeraiah had political and personal rivalries, particularly with Alla Sambayya and Muppa Suresh, stemming from land disputes and local political dominance. Sambayya allegedly orchestrated the murder to gain control over the village and the constituency. Vinod Kumar, who owed Veeraiah money, acted as the primary executioner.">
