    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP's 1990s Redux: BJP, SP Clash Again</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Uttar Pradesh, a political scenario reminiscent of the 1990s is unfolding, with the BJP and SP emerging as dominant forces.  Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and SP president Akhilesh Yadav are leading the charge, mirroring the rivalry between Kalyan Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav during the Mandal vs Kamandal era.

The 1990s witnessed intense political and social turmoil in UP, fueled by the Mandal Commission recommendations and the Ram temple movement. Both Kalyan Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, then chief ministers, faced public pressure and were eventually ousted. 

This time around, the Congress remains inactive, while the BSP is indecisive. The BJP and SP are actively vying for political dominance, leveraging socio-religious sentiments and engaging in sharp rhetoric, reminiscent of the bitter language used in the past.">
