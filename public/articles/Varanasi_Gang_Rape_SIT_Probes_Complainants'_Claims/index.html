    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Gang Rape: SIT Probes Complainants' Claims</title>
    <meta name="description" content="An eight-member SIT has been formed to investigate a gang-rape case in Varanasi after the families of the arrested accused raised doubts about the complainant's claims. The SIT, headed by DCP Pramod Kumar, will probe the case transparently and examine any new facts that emerge. 

The police arrested 14 people in connection with the case. A 19-year-old woman alleged she was confined and gang-raped for five days. She claimed she was drugged and taken to various locations before filing a complaint on April 5. 

The accused families questioned the delay in filing a missing person's report and why the complainant didn't report the rape when she was found by the police.">
