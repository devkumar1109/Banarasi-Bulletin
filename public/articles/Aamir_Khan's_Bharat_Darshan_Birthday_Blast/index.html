    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Aamir Khan's "Bharat Darshan" Birthday Blast</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Aamir Khan celebrated his 60th birthday on March 14. Sixteen years ago, he went on a "Bharat Darshan" disguised as a tourist to promote his film 3 Idiots. 

He traveled across India, blending in with locals and even helping an elderly person find their childhood home in Varanasi.  

Aamir surprised reporters by disappearing during a press conference and leaving a recorded message challenging them to unmask him. He later shared details of his journey, including meeting a young fan in Gujarat and a guide in Mahabalipuram who didn't recognize him.  Aamir also enjoyed a traditional Bengali vegetarian meal at Sourav Ganguly's home in Kolkata.">
