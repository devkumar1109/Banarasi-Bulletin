    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Tamil Nadu Sports Funding: A Six Medal Shortfall</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Tamil Nadu has received ₹29.5 crore under the Khelo India scheme in the last eight years, significantly less than Gujarat (₹605 crore), Uttar Pradesh (₹509 crore), and even Himachal Pradesh and Haryana (₹180 crore each). Despite submitting 12 proposals for infrastructure projects, including stadiums and athletic tracks, none have been approved.  

While states like Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh have received funding for indoor halls, Tamil Nadu's proposals have been rejected. Officials argue that Tamil Nadu, with its large participation in national events and strong performance at the 38th National Games (ranking 6th with 92 medals), deserves greater funding.  

Congress MP Karti Chidambaram has criticized the disparity in allocations and pledged to raise the issue in Parliament.">
