    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - NGT Slams UP on Ganga Pollution During Kumbh</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government and pollution control board over concerns about open defecation along the Ganga river during the Kumbh Mela. An application claimed inadequate sanitation facilities led to high faecal coliform levels in the river water, exceeding the Environment Ministry's benchmark.

Water quality tests revealed faecal coliform levels at the Triveni Sangam exceeding 3,300 MPN per 100 milliliters. The NGT, citing the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report, declared the Ganga water unfit for bathing due to high faecal coliform levels. 

Contaminated water can cause various health issues, prompting the NGT to seek a response from the authorities before the next hearing.">
