    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Shringar Gauri: No Restrictions, Faith Triumphs</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Thousands of devotees joined plaintiffs in worshipping Goddess Shringar Gauri at Gyanvapi on the fourth day of Chaitra Navratri. This marked the first time since the Babri Masjid demolition that there were no restrictions on the number of devotees visiting Shringar Gauri. The Kashi Vishwanath Dham administration facilitated the rituals, providing coconuts, fruit offerings, and assisting with the ceremonial event. 

The Gyanvapi Mukti Mahaparishad, an RSS-supported outfit, organized the event, viewing it as a show of strength for the pro-Hindu government. They claimed that the Gyanvapi complex will be restored to its original state soon, alleging that previous governments obstructed worship due to appeasement politics.  


Tribal girls from Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram also participated in the worship. The GMM president stated that this was the first time temple administration and police officials had actively supported the event.">
