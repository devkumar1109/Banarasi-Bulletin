    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IAS Officer Suspended for Solar Project Bribery</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Abhishek Prakash, a 2006-batch IAS officer and IIT Roorkee alumnus, has been suspended by the Uttar Pradesh government for allegedly demanding a commission for approving a solar project.  

The complainant, Vishwajeet Dutt, alleged that Prakash's office directed him to contact a private individual who demanded a 5% commission.  

This action is part of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's crackdown on corruption, which has resulted in several IAS and PCS officers facing investigation and action.  

Prakash, who served as District Magistrate in several districts, including Lucknow, also held positions as Secretary, Industrial Development Department, and CEO of Invest UP.">
