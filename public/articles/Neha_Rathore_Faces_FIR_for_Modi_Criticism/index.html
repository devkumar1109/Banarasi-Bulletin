    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Neha Rathore Faces FIR for Modi Criticism</title>
    <meta name="description" content="An FIR was filed against folk singer Neha Rathore in Varanasi for remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  The case was filed at the Lanka police station following protests by residents and Hindu organizations.  Over 400 complaints have been lodged against Rathore at various police stations.  She is accused of making "unfounded statements" that have offended national sentiments and of having her videos broadcast on Pakistani media.  Rathore's comments sparked outrage, with some alleging financial support from individuals in India to disseminate her videos, leading to calls for treason charges. This is not Rathore's first controversy; she faced an FIR in Lucknow for sedition and IT Act violations related to a video about the Pahalgam terrorist attack.">
