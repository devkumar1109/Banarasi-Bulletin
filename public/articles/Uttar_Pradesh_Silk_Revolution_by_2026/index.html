    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh government aims to revolutionize its silk industry by 2025-26.  The plan involves linking 7,500 rural groups with the State Rural Livelihood Mission, providing training, technology, and financial aid across 15 districts. The initiative targets increased women's participation in silk production, with a goal of involving 50,000 women from 5,000 groups over the next five years.
