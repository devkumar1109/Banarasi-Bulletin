    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Banke Bihari Temple: Trust Takes Charge</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Yogi Adityanath government constituted a trust to manage the Banke Bihari temple in Mathura, as part of plans to redevelop the Banke Bihari corridor. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav accused the BJP of "indirectly taking control of prominent temples" under the guise of better administration. 

The Department of Religious Affairs, tasked with developing religious institutions and temples, was revived by Akhilesh Yadav during his tenure as CM. Since 2017, the department has gained prominence under Adityanath, with the establishment of several "parishads" for temple development. The government has also increased assistance for pilgrims undertaking religious journeys. The move to establish a trust for Banke Bihari comes after the success of the Kashi Vishwanath corridor redevelopment project.">
