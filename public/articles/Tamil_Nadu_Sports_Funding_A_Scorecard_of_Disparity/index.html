    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Tamil Nadu Sports Funding: A Scorecard of Disparity</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Tamil Nadu received ₹29.5 crore under the Khelo India scheme in the past eight years, significantly less than Gujarat (₹605 crore), Uttar Pradesh (₹509 crore), and Himachal Pradesh/Haryana (₹180 crore each).  Despite numerous proposals, Tamil Nadu only completed synthetic tracks and a swimming pool.  

The state submitted 12 new proposals last year, including multi-purpose stadiums and a hockey field, but none have been approved.  Tamil Nadu officials argue the allocation process is biased against them despite strong sporting performance, ranking sixth in the 2024 National Games with 92 medals. They highlight the need for indoor stadiums in districts for training and development.  Congress MP Karti Chidambaram plans to raise the issue in parliament, criticizing the disparity in funding.">
