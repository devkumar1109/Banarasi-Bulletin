    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Bihar to Zoom: Bullet Train on Track for August.</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Bihar is set to receive its first bullet train, part of the 800-kilometer Varanasi-Patna-Howrah High-Speed Rail Corridor. The 260-kilometer section within Bihar will run on an elevated track, passing through Patna, Buxar, Ara, Jehanabad, and Gaya. 

The National High-Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) is leading the project, with the Detailed Project Report expected by August.  

The bullet train will operate at a top speed of 350 km/h, drastically reducing travel time. 

The project is divided into two phases: the first connecting Varanasi to Howrah, and the second extending the route from Delhi to Varanasi, creating a high-speed network linking Delhi to Howrah. 



The train will feature modern amenities like automatic doors, CCTV cameras, and mobile charging points.">
