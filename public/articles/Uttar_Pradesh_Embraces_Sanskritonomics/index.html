    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Uttar Pradesh Embraces "Sanskritonomics"</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Following the success of the 2025 Maha Kumbh Mela, the Uttar Pradesh government is focusing on "Sanskritonomics", a new initiative combining Sanskrit learning with employment opportunities.  

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has overseen the establishment of 73 new Sanskrit colleges, bringing the total to 184 institutions offering diploma-level Sanskrit courses.  The Uttar Pradesh Secondary Sanskrit Education Council has also introduced four new diploma courses designed to connect students with job opportunities.  

Officials believe Sanskrit education will benefit millions of students, particularly in rural areas, and will lead to economic growth and job creation for the state's youth. The National Education Policy 2020 further supports these initiatives by providing opportunities for 54 lakh children across 27,000 schools.">
