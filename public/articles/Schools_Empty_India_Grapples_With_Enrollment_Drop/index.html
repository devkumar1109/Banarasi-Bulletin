    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Schools Empty: India Grapples With Enrollment Drop</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Enrollment in government schools across 23 Indian states and union territories declined significantly in 2024-25.  The Ministry of Education (MoE) expressed concern and requested states to investigate the reasons for the drop and submit remedial plans by June 30th.

States like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, and West Bengal experienced declines exceeding 100,000 students.  The MoE attributes the decline to potential factors such as the removal of ghost entries and a shift back to private schools post-COVID-19.  This trend follows a broader decline in overall school enrollment (government and private) observed in the UDISE+ report for 2023-24.">
