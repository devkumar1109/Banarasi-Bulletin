    <meta name="description" content="Researchers at IIT-BHU have developed Potassium Ferric Oxalate Nanoparticle (KFeOx-NPs) to prevent blood clotting and thrombosis. 

This novel material effectively prevents clotting for up to 48 hours without affecting blood cell structure. It offers a safer alternative to conventional anticoagulants like warfarin and heparin, which can cause side effects like bleeding and bone density loss. 

KFeOx-NPs were successful in preventing clot formation in human blood samples and a mouse model. The research findings were published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, and a patent has been filed for the nanomaterial.">
