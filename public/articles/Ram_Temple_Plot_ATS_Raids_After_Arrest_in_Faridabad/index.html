    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Ram Temple Plot: ATS Raids After Arrest in Faridabad</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh ATS conducted searches in Lucknow, Azamgarh, Mau, and Ballia following the arrest of 19-year-old Abdul Rehman in Faridabad for plotting an attack on the Ram temple in Ayodhya.  Rehman, an e-rickshaw driver, was found with two hand grenades and was allegedly in contact with radical elements linked to international terror groups.  The searches aimed to identify individuals potentially connected to the plot, focusing on those with questionable credentials and suspicious communications.  While the ATS remained tight-lipped, police sources confirmed the operation.  Rehman's family expressed concern for his health, as he had a history of heart problems and underwent surgery. Locals noted a recent change in his behavior, including withdrawing from social activities and spending more time with a specific group of young men.">
