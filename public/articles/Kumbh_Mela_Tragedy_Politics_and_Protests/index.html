    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Kumbh Mela: Tragedy, Politics, and Protests</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Mahakumbh Mela, a major Hindu pilgrimage, concluded on February 26th after a month and a half.  Three stampede incidents during the event resulted in deaths, prompting criticism from Mamata Banerjee who labeled it a "Mrityu Kumbh". 

While the government claimed over 66 crore pilgrims took a holy dip, videos of the incidents led Prime Minister Modi to apologize for inadequate arrangements.  

Modi, however, also criticized those who "mock and ridicule religion,"  a stance echoed by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath who called critics "vultures."  

The BJP has leveraged the Kumbh for political gain, transforming it into a propaganda tool and portraying itself as central to the event. This has challenged other political parties to find a suitable response.">
