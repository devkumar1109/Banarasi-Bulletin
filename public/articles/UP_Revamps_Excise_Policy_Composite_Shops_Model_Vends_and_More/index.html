    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Revamps Excise Policy: Composite Shops, Model Vends, and More.</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh's new excise policy for 2025-26 is in effect.  It replaces separate foreign liquor and beer shops with composite shops, increasing retail density without adding more shops. Composite shops meeting specific criteria can become model shops serving liquor. 

Country liquor shops can now sell beer, subject to conditions. Low-alcoholic bars (serving beer and wine only) are introduced in Noida, Ghaziabad, Agra, and Lucknow. Bars and premium retail vends can operate in IT and ITeS establishments exceeding 20,000 square meters. Liquor tasting is permitted in wineries, breweries, and distilleries. The policy also introduces a 90 ml category for IMFL and classifies event bar licenses to prevent misuse.">
