    <meta name="description" content="Three sisters from Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh, Kushboo Singh (24), Kavita Chauhan (22), and Sonali Chauhan (20), were selected as police constables on March 15th, 2025.  They had been preparing for this for four years, with a rigorous training routine that included cycling 10km daily and participating in various sports at national and state levels. 

The Uttar Pradesh Police Recruitment and Promotion Board (UPPRPB) announced the final selection results for 60,244 constable positions, out of nearly 48 lakh applications. The sisters were selected under the "dependent of freedom fighter" quota.

Their selection comes just before Holi, adding an extra reason for celebration.  They will now undergo a medical examination before officially joining the force.">
