    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Nehru: Champion of India's Linguistic Tapestry</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, is known for his linguistic cosmopolitanism.  Robert D. King's book "Nehru and the Language Politics of India" highlights Nehru's nuanced approach to India's linguistic diversity.  

In a 1963 speech, Nehru advocated for the vitality of both Hindi and Urdu, emphasizing their interconnectedness and mutual strength. He criticized "Hindi zealots" for their narrow perspective and defended Urdu as a symbol of Hindu-Muslim harmony and secular India. Nehru's own linguistic background, influenced by his Kashmiri heritage and exposure to Persian and Urdu, shaped his cosmopolitan outlook.  

While Nehru's approach to nation-building has been criticized by right-wing forces under the BJP regime, his vision of a linguistically diverse and inclusive India remains a significant point of reference.">
