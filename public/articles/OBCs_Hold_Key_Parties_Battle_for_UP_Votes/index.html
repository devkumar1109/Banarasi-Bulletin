    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - OBCs Hold Key: Parties Battle for UP Votes</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Ahead of the 2027 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, all major political parties are focusing on wooing the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), who constitute about half of the state's population. 

The BJP, undergoing an organizational overhaul, has appointed 26 OBC district chiefs out of 70, aiming for 50% representation of OBCs, SCs, and women in state units.  

The SP, riding on its "PDA (Pichda, Dalit, Alpsankhyak) plank", has launched the "PDA charcha" campaign, involving MLAs and MPs in outreach programs to address concerns of oppressed communities.

The BSP has revived its "Bhaichara Committees" to connect with OBC voters. 
 
The BJP relies on allies like SBSP, Apna Dal (Sonelal), NISHAD Party, and RLD to consolidate OBC votes.">
