    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - "Another Round" Crash Leaves One Dead in Vadodara</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A 23-year-old law student, Rakshit Chaurasia, from Varanasi, has been arrested for a car crash in Vadodara that killed a woman and injured several others.  Chaurasia was heard shouting "another round" at the scene, prompting speculation about the meaning.  Police discovered a poster for the Danish film "Another Round" (Druk) in his apartment. The film explores the lives of four teachers who experiment with maintaining a low level of intoxication.  Chaurasia was reportedly intoxicated and was part of a group of four who were seen on CCTV visiting a friend's house before the crash. He has been charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.">
