    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Uncle, Aunt Arrested for Nephew's Strangulation</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh, Chetram Gautam and his wife Sundari Devi were arrested for murdering their 22-year-old nephew, Bhanu Pratap alias Sudhir. Bhanu's body was found in a sack near a school on March 29, with a rope around his neck.  Police investigation, involving CCTV analysis, phone records, and witness interviews, led to the couple's arrest. They confessed to killing Bhanu after finding him in an "objectionable condition" with a girl from their family. 

The couple strangled Bhanu, placed his body in a sack, tied a rope around his neck to make the death appear suspicious, and dumped the body.  Bhanu's father had filed a complaint accusing Chetram and his family of the murder. The couple was sent to jail after their confession.">
