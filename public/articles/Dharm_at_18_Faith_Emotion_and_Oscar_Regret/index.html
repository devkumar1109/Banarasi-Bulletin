    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - "Dharm" at 18: Faith, Emotion, and Oscar Regret</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Subhash K Jha celebrates the 18th anniversary of Bhavna Talwar's film "Dharm," praising its exploration of religion and human emotion. Set in Varanasi, the film follows Pundit Chaturvedi, a priest grappling with religious rituals and personal conscience.  Talwar's direction is lauded for its sensitivity and compassion, capturing the complexities of faith and societal pressures. 

Talwar expressed disappointment that her film, a strong contender for India's Oscar entry, lost to Vinod Chopra's "Eklavya."  She criticized the selection process, alleging a violation of rules and questioning the motives behind the choice. Talwar believes "Eklavya" should have been submitted in technical categories if deemed worthy.">
