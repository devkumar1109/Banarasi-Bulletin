    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Takes Aim at TB with CY TB Tests</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Varanasi, CY TB tests are being launched as part of the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program to detect TB infections in high-risk individuals.  These tests will be conducted at hospitals for groups like those with silicosis, undergoing dialysis or chemotherapy, and individuals with diabetes, malnutrition, smoking, or alcohol consumption habits. 

Approximately 15,000 doses of CY TB have been allocated to Varanasi. The test involves an intradermal injection, with results available within 48-72 hours.  If positive, individuals will receive TB preventive treatment (TPT).  The goal is to increase the annual decline in TB incidence rate from 2.5% to 10% and eventually make the district TB-free.">
