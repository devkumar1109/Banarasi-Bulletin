    <meta name="description" content="A team from IIT (BHU), Varanasi won the Forensic Hackathon 2025 for developing a glycan-based forensic technology that accurately estimates age using biological fluids. This technology, led by Prof. Sumit Kumar Singh, uses glycomic profiling and machine learning to decode molecular signatures, offering insights into an individual's health and physiological condition. 

Traditional DNA-based methods often face limitations in accuracy due to biological variability and degraded samples. The IIT (BHU) team's glycan-based approach overcomes these challenges by analyzing complex sugar molecules that change systematically with age and health. 

This innovative technology, which received a cash prize of Rs two lakh, has the potential to revolutionize forensic investigations in India by providing valuable insights into age and health status.">
