    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT-BHU's Nano-Cure: Safe Blood Thinning Breakthrough</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Researchers at IIT-BHU have developed a novel material, Potassium Ferric Oxalate Nanoparticle (KFeOx-NPs), to prevent blood coagulation and thrombosis. This material offers a safer alternative to conventional anticoagulants like warfarin and heparin, which can cause side effects such as excessive bleeding, reduced bone density, and birth defects. 

KFeOx-NPs effectively prevent clotting for up to 48 hours without affecting blood cell structure or integrity.  

This makes it suitable for clinical blood collection and storage.  Efficacy was validated in a mouse model, demonstrating its ability to prevent clot formation. Blood clot-related disorders, such as strokes, heart attacks, and pulmonary embolism, are major causes of mortality worldwide.">
