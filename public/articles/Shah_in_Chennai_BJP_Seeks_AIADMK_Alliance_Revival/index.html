    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Shah in Chennai: BJP Seeks AIADMK Alliance Revival</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Union Home Minister Amit Shah's visit to Chennai is crucial for the BJP as it seeks to revive its alliance with the AIADMK ahead of next year's Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. The AIADMK has set conditions for the alliance, including choosing its own Chief Ministerial candidate and finalizing alliance decisions.  Shah is expected to address these issues and meet with state BJP functionaries and RSS ideologue S Gurumurthy.

Meanwhile, PM Modi will be in Varanasi and Madhya Pradesh. Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj party will hold a rally in Patna.  S Jaishankar will address India's Global Technology Summit in Delhi. The BJP faces a challenge in the South, with Tamil Nadu being a key battleground. The DMK, led by Chief Minister M K Stalin, has emerged as a strong opposition force.">
