    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Akhilesh's Choice: Terhavi Tradition Challenged</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Following Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav's decision to forgo the thirteenth-day mourning ritual (terhavi) for his father Mulayam Singh Yadav, the practice is being abandoned by many Yadav families in Uttar Pradesh. 

Traditionally, terhavi involves pind daan, donations, and feasts, often causing financial strain for poorer families. Akhilesh's example, inspired by his father's ideology of reform, has emboldened families to challenge the ritual. 

Individuals like Vinay Yadav from Saifai and Manoj Yadav from Prayagraj, who faced criticism for not performing terhavi previously, now cite Mulayam Singh's decision as justification. This movement, fueled by Akhilesh's leadership, signifies a shift in social norms within the Yadav community.">
