    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - OBC Vote: 2027 UP Elections Battleground</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Ahead of the 2027 UP Assembly elections, all major political parties are focusing on wooing the OBC community, which comprises half of the state's population.  

The BJP, while undergoing an organizational overhaul, has appointed 26 OBC district chiefs out of 70, claiming representation will increase with the remaining appointments. They also rely on allies like SBSP, Apna Dal (Sonelal), NISHAD Party, and RLD to consolidate OBC votes.

The SP, a key constituent of the INDIA bloc, has launched the "PDA charcha" campaign, aimed at engaging with the PDA (Pichda, Dalit, Alpsankhyak) communities. BSP has revived its "Bhaichara Committees" for similar outreach.  
 
 The OBC vote is crucial, considered a deciding factor in at least 300 of the 403 constituencies.">
