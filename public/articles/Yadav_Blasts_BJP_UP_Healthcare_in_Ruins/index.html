    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Yadav Blasts BJP: UP Healthcare in Ruins</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Samajwadi Party (SP) President Akhilesh Yadav accused the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh of ruining the state's health services. 

Yadav alleged negligence in hospitals, inadequate medicines and treatment for the poor, and a lack of facilities in medical colleges. He claimed hospitals are dominated by middlemen, and corruption has crippled the system. 

Yadav criticized the BJP for not building any new district-level hospitals and failing to maintain existing ones. He highlighted the poor condition of primary health centers (PHCs) and community health centers (CHCs), and pointed to incomplete medical college buildings lacking even basic amenities like ambulances. 

Yadav further alleged that fire incidents in hospitals are a result of negligence, putting patients' lives at risk. He contrasted the SP government's focus on treating serious diseases with the BJP's alleged neglect of medical colleges and a shortage of specialist doctors.">
