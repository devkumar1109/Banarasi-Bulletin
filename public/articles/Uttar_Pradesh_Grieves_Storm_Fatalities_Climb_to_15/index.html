Incidents included a unipole falling on a car, a tree crushing a man, and a collapsed wall trapping a worker. Lightning strikes killed two men in Saharanpur district.  Winds toppled trees, damaged property, and caused widespread power outages.  

A fire erupted in an oil factory in Budaun after the storm caused a portion of the building to collapse, sparking an oil fire.  A subsequent explosion occurred but did not result in casualties.  A constable died in Bijnor when his motorcycle collided with a fallen tree. CM Yogi Adityanath has ordered relief and compensation measures.">
