The government plans to invest Rs 20,000 crore in Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) to significantly increase India's nuclear capacity by 2047. This move is driven by the need for reliable and cost-effective energy to power AI's computational demands. 

India also aims to develop low-cost, sovereign large language models (LLMs) tailored to Indian context and culture.  Prime Minister Modi's participation in the AI Action Summit in Paris underscores India's commitment to becoming a major player in the global AI ecosystem.">
