    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Greenery Booms, Solar Cities On Rise</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath stated that 210 crore trees have been planted across the state in the last eight years, resulting in a significant increase in forest cover despite rapid urbanization and industrial growth.  The government is monitoring the survival rate of these trees through independent institutions.  

Adityanath announced plans to transform 17 municipal corporation areas into "solar cities," following the model of Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh's first Solar City. He expressed concern over rising air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region, attributing it to the continued use of wood and coal for fuel. He highlighted the positive impact of the Ujjwala Yojana in providing free LPG cylinders, but urged a broader shift towards cleaner energy sources for improved air quality and public health.">
