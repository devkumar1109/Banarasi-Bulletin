    <meta name="description" content="Villagers in Malu Kantu, Gujarat, have created spiked collars for their dogs to protect them from leopard attacks. The collars, made with nails protruding outwards, deter leopards who typically kill dogs by biting their necks. This "jugaad" has reportedly decreased dog fatalities from leopard attacks, safeguarding both the animals and villagers' crops. Leopards are common in the area, with 15-20 inhabiting the Rajgadh range, and often prey on dogs and goats.  While villagers rely on dogs for crop protection and as watchdogs, leopard attacks often go unreported.">
