    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Liking ≠ Publishing: HC Sets Social Media Precedent</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Allahabad High Court ruled that liking a social media post does not constitute publishing or transmitting it. This decision stems from a case where Imran Khan was charged under Section 67 of the IT Act for "publishing obscene materials" based on liking a post about an unlawful assembly. The court clarified that Section 67 applies to posting and sharing content, not liking it. 

This ruling echoes a 2023 Allahabad HC judgment and emphasizes the distinction between passive engagement and active publication on social media.  The court's decision has significant implications for free speech, digital privacy, and platform liability in India.">
