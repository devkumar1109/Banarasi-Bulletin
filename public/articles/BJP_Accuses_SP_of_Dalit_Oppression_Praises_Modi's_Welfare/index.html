Singh criticized Congress for its alleged opposition to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and its attempts to weaken constitutional rights, including reservations.  He highlighted Prime Minister Narendra Modi's initiatives like Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and providing free ration during the Covid-19 pandemic as examples of the BJP's commitment to social welfare.">
