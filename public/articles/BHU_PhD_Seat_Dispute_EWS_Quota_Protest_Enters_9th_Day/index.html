    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BHU PhD Seat Dispute: EWS Quota Protest Enters 9th Day</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Archita Singh, a PhD aspirant at Banaras Hindu University (BHU), is staging a sit-in protest for over eight days demanding admission to the PhD (Hindi) program through EWS quota.  She claims that despite qualifying and providing necessary documents, including an undertaking for her EWS certificate, the university's admission committee has not sent her admission link.  

Her protest follows a similar 17-day demonstration by another student, Shivam Sonkar, who secured admission. The issue has attracted attention from political parties and caste-based organizations, with Archita being approached by officials and representatives.  

The university's administration, currently without a permanent vice-chancellor, has formed a committee to investigate the matter and is awaiting their report.">
