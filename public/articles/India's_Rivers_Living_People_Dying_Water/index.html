    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - India's Rivers: Living People, Dying Water</title>
    <meta name="description" content="India's rivers are facing severe pollution despite the country recognizing them as "living people".  A recent report by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) revealed that water quality at several locations in Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh did not meet bathing standards due to high faecal coliform levels. While a subsequent report claimed the water was fit for bathing, the incident highlights the alarming state of river pollution.  Rapid urbanization and industrial growth are major contributors to this issue, with untreated or partially treated effluents discharged into rivers, causing ecological degradation and public health risks. The Supreme Court recently termed the pollution caused by tanneries in Tamil Nadu's Vellore district as "ecocide", emphasizing the urgency of addressing this problem.">
