    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Gujarat, UP Left Out: India Secy Panel Sparks Speculation</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The latest empanelment for secretary-level posts in the Government of India excludes officers from Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, raising speculation. This is unusual as these states are politically significant and typically well-represented. The government's explanation for the delay in empanelment for the 1994 batch is unclear, with potential reasons including a shortage of secretary-level posts or a backlog of senior officers awaiting their turn. 

Separately, a land scam involving 10 IAS officers and a former Noida Authority CEO is under investigation by the CBI. The scandal revolves around the Noida Sports City project where rules were allegedly twisted to benefit builders, resulting in financial irregularities and disregard for regulatory commitments.">
