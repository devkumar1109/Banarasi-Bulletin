    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT Placements: Prestige Plummets, Crisis Grows</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Over half of India's 23 IITs experienced a significant decline in job placements for BTech students between 2021-22 and 2023-24.  Some of the most prestigious IITs, including Madras, Bombay, Kanpur, and Delhi, saw drops of 12 to 15 percentage points. 

Newer IITs were hit hardest, with IIT Dharwad's placements plummeting by nearly 25 percentage points.  In 2021-22, 14 IITs had over 90% placements, but by 2023-24, only three achieved that benchmark.

This decline coincides with a drop in average financial packages offered to students.  While factors like higher education and entrepreneurship may contribute, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education expressed concern that this downturn reflects a broader employment crisis.">
