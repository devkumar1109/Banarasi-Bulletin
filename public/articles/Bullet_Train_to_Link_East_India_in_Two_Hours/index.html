    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Bullet Train to Link East India in Two Hours</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Indian Railways is developing a 760km Varanasi-Patna-Howrah bullet train corridor, aiming to significantly reduce travel time between eastern Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal to as little as two hours. The project, currently in the Detailed Project Report (DPR) stage, involves surveys, land acquisition, and construction of elevated tracks in Bihar. 

The high-speed rail line will pass through major cities like Buxar, Ara, Patna, Gaya, Dhanbad, Asansol, Durgapur, and Burdwan.  Stations are planned at Buxar, Patna, Gaya, Dhanbad, Asansol, Durgapur, and Howrah, with potential additional stops at Ara and Nawada. 

Construction is expected to begin soon, with a projected completion date of mid-2027. This corridor is part of India's larger high-speed rail strategy to enhance inter-state connectivity and promote economic growth.">
