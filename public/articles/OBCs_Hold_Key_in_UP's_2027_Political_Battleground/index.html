    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - OBCs Hold Key in UP's 2027 Political Battleground</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Ahead of the 2027 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, political parties are actively courting the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), who constitute roughly half of the state's population. 

The BJP, while undergoing an organizational revamp, has appointed 26 OBC leaders as district chiefs out of 70, with promises of increased representation for SCs and women in the remaining appointments. The party also leverages its OBC-centric allies like SBSP, Apna Dal (Sonelal), NISHAD Party, and RLD.

The Samajwadi Party (SP), a key member of the INDIA bloc, has launched a "PDA charcha" campaign, involving MLAs and MPs engaging with the OBC, Dalit, and minority communities. The BSP has revived its "Bhaichara Committees" to connect with the OBCs.">
