    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP BJP Confident of Third Consecutive Win</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya claims the BJP-led alliance will secure a third consecutive term in Uttar Pradesh in the 2027 elections. He attributes this to the Yogi Adityanath government's achievements in good governance, security, and development, contrasting it with the previous SP regime. 

Maurya highlights the implementation of PM schemes benefiting women, youth, farmers, and employment, as well as infrastructure projects in Varanasi worth over Rs 40,536 crore.  He cites projects like Kashi Vishwanath Dham and Namo Ghat as examples of the government's positive impact on the region.  Maurya believes the opposition, even if united, cannot defeat the BJP in the upcoming elections.">
