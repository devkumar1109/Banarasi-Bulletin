    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - NGT Slams UP Over Kumbh Mela Ganga Pollution</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government and related authorities regarding open defecation along the Ganga river during the Kumbh Mela.  

An application highlighted the poor sanitation arrangements, citing a water quality test showing faecal coliform levels exceeding permissible limits. The NGT also received a report from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) indicating high faecal coliform levels in the Ganga, rendering the water unfit for bathing. 

These elevated levels pose health risks as faecal coliform bacteria, typically found in animal and human waste, can cause various illnesses. The NGT has scheduled a hearing for Monday to address the concerns.">
