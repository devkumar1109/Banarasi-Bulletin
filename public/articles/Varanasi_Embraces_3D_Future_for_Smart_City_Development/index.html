The project, costing Rs six crore, took nine months to complete and uses cutting-edge GIS technology like LiDAR and 360-degree imagery.  The 3D model covers 160 square kilometers and includes details of alleys, the Ganga river, temples, and key locations.  

The technology will aid in sustainable development, flood management, and real-time response to emergencies. It provides precise measurements of infrastructure and allows departments to assess the feasibility of development projects.  Cameras connected to key locations will enable crowd management, crime control, and traffic monitoring.">
