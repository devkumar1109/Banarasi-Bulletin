    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Cities and Farms Spark More Lightning</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A recent study by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and other institutions reveals that urbanization and agriculture contribute to increased lightning strikes in north and northeast India. 

Areas with less vegetation, such as farmlands and cities, heat up faster, creating conditions favorable for thunderstorms.  

The study, published in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics, analyzed lightning data from 2001 to 2014.  

It found that north India experiences more lightning flashes annually compared to northeast India, peaking during the monsoon season. 

Conversely, natural landscapes like forests and wetlands show moderate lightning activity, suggesting vegetation's role in maintaining soil moisture.">
