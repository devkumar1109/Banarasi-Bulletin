    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Krishna Takes Helm: New DGP for UP</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Rajeev Krishna, a 1991 batch IPS officer, has been appointed as the new Director General of Police (DGP) of Uttar Pradesh, replacing Prashant Kumar. Krishna brings over three decades of experience, having held various key positions including SSP in several cities like Etawah, Mathura, and Agra. 

His appointment comes at a crucial time with many senior officers set to retire, potentially impacting his recognition as permanent DGP by the UPSC. However, his close proximity to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, evident in his handling of police recruitment examinations, indicates the CM's confidence in Krishna's abilities.  

Krishna is tasked with maintaining law and order, combating crime, and ensuring the safety and security of Uttar Pradesh's citizens.">
