    <meta name="description" content="Rakshit Chaurasia, accused in the Vadodara Hit-and-Run case, has been sent to police remand for two days.  The incident, captured in a viral video, occurred around 12:30 am on Friday in Karelibaug, Vadodara, where Chaurasia allegedly sped his car, hitting a woman and injuring several others. The 34-year-old woman died in the accident. Police will investigate why Chaurasia yelled "Another Round" after the incident and who he was referring to when repeatedly mentioning a girl's name. 

A case has been registered against Chaurasia under BNS sections, and a rapid drug test indicated intoxication, with a blood test pending. Three vehicles were involved, including two active vehicles and an EV.  Victims sustained various injuries, with one person's wife and two children hospitalized after their scooter was struck.">
