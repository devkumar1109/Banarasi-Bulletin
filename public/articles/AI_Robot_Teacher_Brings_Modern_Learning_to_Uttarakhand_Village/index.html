    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - AI Robot Teacher Brings Modern Learning to Uttarakhand Village</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In a remote Uttarakhand village, 35 km from Pithoragarh, students at a government primary school are learning with the help of an AI-powered robotic teacher named Eco. Eco, imported from China, can operate in both Hindi and English and was funded through local contributions and support from a friend of the school headmaster.  

The school, which has 52 students and five teachers, lacks basic technological infrastructure but is committed to providing a modern education. Eco teaches math, conducts extracurricular activities, and helps students build digital literacy. Students are excited to interact with Eco, who answers questions, corrects mistakes, and motivates them to explore new ideas.">
