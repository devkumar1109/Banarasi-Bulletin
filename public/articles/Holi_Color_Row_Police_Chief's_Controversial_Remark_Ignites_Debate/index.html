    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Holi Color Row: Police Chief's Controversial Remark Ignites Debate</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A senior police officer in Uttar Pradesh sparked controversy by suggesting people who can't tolerate colour should stay indoors on Holi, which coincides with Friday prayers this year. The officer, Anuj Chaudhary, made the remark during a peace committee meeting. His statement drew criticism as it implies acceptance of colour application even without consent, contradicting UP Government Servants Conduct Rules and the Ministry of Home Affairs’ Model Code of Conduct for Indian Police.  

Former UP DGPs Sukhkan Singh and Vikram Singh condemned the officer's comments, emphasizing the police's duty to ensure safety and neutrality. UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath defended Chaudhary, suggesting those who wish to offer Friday prayers can do so at home, which contradicts Islamic teaching.  

Critics argue the officer's statement sets a dangerous precedent by comparing religious practices and potentially violating constitutional secularism.">
