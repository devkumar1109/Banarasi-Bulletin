    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Clubfoot Conquered: 70 Varanasi Children Walk Free</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Since 2019, 70 children with clubfoot have recovered in Varanasi through a program run by the health department and Anushka Foundation.  

512 children have been treated, with 64 already recovered. Free treatment is offered at specific hospitals on designated days. The program utilizes the Ponseti method, which involves casting, tenotomy, and bracing to correct the deformity. 

Early treatment within the first few months of birth yields the best outcomes. Parents are encouraged to seek treatment if they notice their newborn's feet are crooked, as clubfoot is treatable and does not affect a child's long-term health.">
