    <meta name="description" content="Here is a summary of the news article in 150 words:

BJP spokesman Sudhanshu Trivedi accused the opposition of seeking political gain from the Maha Kumbh tragedy, where several people lost their lives in a stampede. Trivedi criticized Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav for questioning the death toll and using terms like "Mrityu Kumbh". He claimed that the opposition is trying to gain political mileage from the incident instead of showing sensitivity. Trivedi also praised the successful organization of Maha Kumbh in UP, stating that it has boosted the economy and played a major role in cultural awakening. Additionally, he criticized the opposition for opposing India's efforts to tackle illegal immigration, citing the example of the US deporting illegal Indian immigrants. Trivedi alleged that the opposition sees illegal immigrants as a vote bank and has not taken action against them.">
