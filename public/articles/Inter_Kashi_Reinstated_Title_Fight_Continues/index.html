    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Inter Kashi Reinstated, Title Fight Continues</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Inter Kashi won their first appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the All India Football Federation (AIFF) regarding a three-point deduction.  

The deduction stemmed from a disputed match against Namdhari FC, where Namdhari was accused of fielding an ineligible player.  While this ruling reverses the initial deduction, it doesn't automatically crown Inter Kashi I-League champions.  

Churchill Brothers were declared champions based on the AIFF appeals committee's decision, but Inter Kashi has another pending appeal at CAS which could determine the final winner.  The CAS ordered AIFF, Churchill Brothers, and Namdhari FC to pay Inter Kashi compensation for legal costs.">
