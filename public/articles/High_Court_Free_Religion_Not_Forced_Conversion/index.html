    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - High Court: Free Religion, Not Forced Conversion</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Allahabad High Court ruled that the Indian Constitution protects the right to freely practice religion but does not allow forced or fraudulent conversions.  The court rejected a plea to dismiss an FIR against four people accused of trying to convert people to Christianity by offering money and free medical care.  Justice Vinod Diwaker stated that the Constitution guarantees religious freedom but not at the expense of coercion or deception.  The court emphasized the importance of secularism and equal respect for all religions, stating that the state should maintain a neutral stance towards all faiths.  The ruling also highlighted that the 2021 Uttar Pradesh Act prohibiting unlawful religious conversion is aimed at preserving public order, morality, and health.">
