    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Shringar Gauri: Devotees Flock, Freedom Claimed</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Thousands of devotees joined plaintiffs in worshipping Goddess Shringar Gauri at the Gyanvapi complex on Wednesday, the fourth day of Chaitra Navratri. 

This marked the first time since the Babri Masjid demolition that there were no restrictions on the number of devotees visiting Shringar Gauri. The Kashi Vishwanath Dham administration facilitated the prayers, providing coconuts, fruit offerings, and logistical support.

Gyanvapi Mukti Mahaparishad, an RSS-supported outfit, organized the event, viewing it as a symbol of growing strength for the pro-Hindu government. They claim the Gyanvapi complex will be restored to its original state soon. The event also saw participation from tribal girls and activists pledging to liberate all ancient historical sites in the country.">
