    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Fights Disease with Eco-Friendly Fogging</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Varanasi, the health department is implementing cold fogging to combat dengue and malaria. A trial was successfully conducted in Prime Minister Model Village Kurhua using a water-based insecticide solution.  

This method, unlike traditional thermal fogging which uses diesel, produces a mist instead of smoke, minimizing environmental pollution. Cold fogging will be used in 45 houses around patients, sensitive village panchayats, and wards during the infection period (July-November).  

The District Malaria Officer highlighted the benefits of this innovation, stating that it will help control mosquito populations and prevent mosquito-borne diseases.">
