    <meta name="description" content="Abbas Ansari, an SBSP MLA from Mau Sadar, was sentenced to two years imprisonment for a hate speech incident in 2022.  The court, while pronouncing the sentence, stated that hate speech has no place in public service, especially when it aims to influence elections or intimidate officials. 

The judge highlighted that such speech can disrupt communal harmony and undermine the democratic process. The court considered Ansari's criminal history and the fact that his family has held the Mau Sadar seat for nearly 20 years while deciding the punishment.  Ansari had threatened state government officials during his 2022 election campaign, promising to hold them accountable for their actions.">
