    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Fights Hypertension with Month-Long Campaign</title>
    <meta name="description" content="To mark World Hypertension Day on May 17, Varanasi's health department launched a month-long campaign focusing on prevention, early detection, and treatment of hypertension. 

The campaign includes awareness programs, walkathons, marathons, rallies, quizzes, and street plays at district hospitals, CHCs, and PHCs. Free screening camps for hypertension, diabetes, and cancer will be held at government health units, bus stands, railway stations, and urban slums.

Dr. YB Pathak, deputy CMO and program nodal officer, urges everyone over 30 to regularly check their blood pressure. 

Hypertension, or high blood pressure, often results from an irregular lifestyle, obesity, stress, and poor diet, leading to serious conditions like heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease. 
Preventive measures include maintaining a balanced diet, exercising regularly, avoiding smoking and alcohol, and monitoring blood pressure.">
