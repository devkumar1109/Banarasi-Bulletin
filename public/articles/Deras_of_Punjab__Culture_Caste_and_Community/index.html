    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Deras of Punjab:  Culture, Caste, and Community</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Santosh K Singh's new book, "The Deras: Culture, Diversity and Politics," explores the complex world of Punjab's Deras, highlighting their socio-political significance. Singh's research began with observing labourers wearing Dera symbols, leading him to uncover the Deras's rich history and layered structure. 

While some Deras attract controversy, Singh emphasizes the diversity within this religious space, noting that many cater to Dalit communities who seek equality and a sense of belonging. 

He attributes the Deras's popularity to historical and sociological factors, particularly the persistence of caste in Punjab despite Sikhism's egalitarian ideals. Deras offer not only solace but also a renewed sense of identity and community for Dalits seeking a caste-neutral space.">
