    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - "Sweet Solution: India's First Biopolymer Plant to Tackle Single-Use Plastics"</title>
    <meta name="description" content="India's first biopolymer manufacturing plant will be set up in Uttar Pradesh with an investment of Rs 2,850 crore. The plant, owned by Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd, will manufacture eco-friendly alternatives to single-use plastics, supporting India's net zero emissions target. The biopolymer, Polylactic Acid (PLA), will be created from raw materials like sugar, corn, and tapioca, and used to make biodegradable daily-use items like cups and cutlery. The plant will operate on renewable energy and commence operations by December 2026 with an initial capacity of 80,000 tonnes. It aims to advance the 'Make in India' and 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' vision, reducing environmental pollution and generating employment. The plant has collaborated with Alpine from Austria and Sulzer from Switzerland for technology transfer to improve sugar-to-PLA conversion, currently requiring 1.6 kilograms of sugar per kilogram of PLA.">
