    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh government is expanding Jai Prakash Narayan Sarvodaya Vidyalayas to provide quality education to underprivileged children. The number of these schools will increase to 120 by 2024-25, up from 93 in 2017.  Currently, 100 schools are operational, with 70 for boys and 30 for girls. Each school accommodates 490 students.
