    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Kerala ASHAs Demand Fair Pay and Benefits</title>
    <meta name="description" content="ASHA workers, Accredited Social Health Activists, are community volunteers trained to help people access government healthcare schemes. They connect marginalized communities with primary health centers, sub-centers, and district hospitals. 

Kerala's ASHA workers are protesting for increased honorariums and retirement benefits, currently seeking ₹21,000 per month and a ₹5 lakh one-time payment.  The National Health Mission (NHM) has approved increased incentives for ASHAs, which will be implemented soon. 

The ASHA program originated from Chhattisgarh's successful Mitanin program and was established under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) in 2005. The NRHM merged with the National Urban Health Mission in 2013 to form the current NHM.">
