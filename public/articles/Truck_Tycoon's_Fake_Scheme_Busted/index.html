    <meta name="description" content="Abhishek Yadav, a 28-year-old from Madhya Pradesh, was arrested in Varanasi for selling 20 trucks worth Rs 4 crore to scrap dealers using fake registration documents.  He would book trucks through brokers, claiming to rent them, and then sell them for profit.  

Yadav contacted truck owners through Facebook brokers, offering higher rental rates and bribing them to gain trust. He would pay half the rental upfront, take possession of the trucks, and then sell them to a scrap dealer named Shafiq alias Chakki in Nagpur for Rs 5 lakhs each.  The police investigation began after receiving complaints about missing trucks and suspicious booking agents.">
