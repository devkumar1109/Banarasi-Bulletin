    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT BHU Wins Forensic Hackathon with Age-Decoding Tech</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A team from IIT (BHU), Varanasi, won the Forensic Hackathon 2025 for developing a glycan-based forensic technology that accurately estimates age using biological fluids.  

The technology, led by Prof. Sumit Kumar Singh, uses glycomic profiling and machine learning to decode molecular signatures, providing insights into an individual's health and physiological condition. 

This innovative method overcomes limitations of DNA-based age estimation, which often struggles with degraded samples or diverse backgrounds common in forensic settings. The technology's ability to estimate both chronological and biological age offers valuable context for criminal investigations.">
