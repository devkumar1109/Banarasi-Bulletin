    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BJP's UP Chief Hunt: Caste Calculus Grips Party</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The BJP is facing a prolonged delay in appointing a new Uttar Pradesh (UP) state president, a position vacant since January 2023. This impasse stems from the party's struggle to balance caste representation and electoral strategy ahead of the 2027 Assembly elections. 

The Samajwadi Party's (SP) "Pichhda, Dalit, Alpsankhyak" (Backward, Dalit, Minority) alliance has challenged the BJP's traditional coalition, prompting the party to consider candidates from OBC and Dalit communities to avoid projecting an upper-caste face. However, factionalism within these groups hinders consensus. 

National-level factors, including the recent Pahalgam terrorist attack and the extension of BJP national president JP Nadda's term, have also contributed to the delay.  The BJP's decision to conduct a caste census is seen as a counter to the SP's PDA narrative, making the selection of the next state president highly symbolic.">
