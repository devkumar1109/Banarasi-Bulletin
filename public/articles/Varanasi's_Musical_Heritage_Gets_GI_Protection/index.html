The Banaras Shehnai, popularized by legendary maestro Ustad Bismillah Khan, is a double-reed woodwind instrument integral to Varanasi's cultural landscape.  

The Banaras Tabla, crafted from various woods like sheesham and neem, is another cherished instrument with roots in the city. Renowned tabla player Pandit Kishan Maharaj belonged to the Banaras gharana of Hindustani classical music.
