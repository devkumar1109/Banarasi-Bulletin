    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - "Bhool Chuk Maaf"  Gets Two New Songs,  May 9 Release</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The release of the Rajkummar Rao and Wamiqa Gabbi-starrer "Bhool Chuk Maaf" has been moved to May 9. The delay allows for the addition of two new songs to the romantic comedy.  

One song, a peppy promotional number composed by Tanishk Bagchi, was filmed at a studio in Mira Road.  

The second song, a romantic bachelorette party themed track, will be shot in Varanasi in mid-April. Both songs are choreographed by Vijay Ganguly and feature costumes by Sheetal Sharma. 


"Bhool Chuk Maaf" revolves around Rao's character, who gets stuck in a time loop a day before his wedding.">
