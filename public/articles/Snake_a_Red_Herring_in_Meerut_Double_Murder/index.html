    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Snake a Red Herring in Meerut Double Murder</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, a 25-year-old laborer named Amit was strangled to death by his wife, Ravita, and her lover, Amardeep. To conceal the crime, they placed a live snake next to Amit's body, falsely claiming he died from a snake bite. 

Locals discovered the snake, but suspicions arose, leading to an autopsy. The report revealed strangulation as the cause of death. Police arrested Ravita and Amardeep, charging them with murder. This incident follows a similar case in Meerut last month where a man was murdered by his wife and her lover, who dismembered the body and hid it in a cement drum.">
