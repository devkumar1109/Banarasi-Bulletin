    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Cold Fog: Varanasi Battles Dengue with Eco-Friendly Mist</title>
    <meta name="description" content="To prevent dengue and malaria, Varanasi is implementing a cold fogging trial. This method uses water mixed with insecticide to produce mist, unlike traditional thermal fogging which uses diesel. 

The trial began in Prime Minister's Model Village Kurhua and will be used in 45 houses around dengue patients.  

Cold fogging will also be used in sensitive village panchayats and wards, particularly from July to November, the peak dengue season. 

The water-based approach aims to control mosquitoes while minimizing environmental pollution.">
