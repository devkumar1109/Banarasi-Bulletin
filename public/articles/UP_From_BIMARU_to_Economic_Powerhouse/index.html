    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP: From BIMARU to Economic Powerhouse</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath claims the state has transformed from a lagging economy to India's economic powerhouse in the past eight years, attributing the progress to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's policies. 

Before 2017, Uttar Pradesh was considered one of India's 'BIMARU' states. However, Adityanath highlights significant agricultural growth, with the state's growth rate rising from 5% in 2016-17 to over 13.5% currently. Food grain production has also increased from 557 lakh metric tonnes in 2016-17 to over 668 lakh metric tonnes last year. Adityanath credits the initial waiver of Rs 36,000 crore in farmers' loans and subsequent agricultural reforms for this turnaround.">
