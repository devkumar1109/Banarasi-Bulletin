    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Rape: SIT Probes Complainant's Claims</title>
    <meta name="description" content="An eight-member SIT has been formed to investigate the Varanasi gang-rape case after the families of the arrested accused raised concerns about the complainant's claims.  

The SIT, headed by DCP Pramod Kumar, will examine inconsistencies in the woman's statement, including the delay in filing a missing person's report and the lack of immediate police reporting upon her recovery. The families allege the complainant stayed at her friend's house for several days without reporting the alleged assault.  

14 individuals have been arrested in connection with the case, with the FIR naming 12 and identifying 11 others. The SIT will also investigate any new facts that emerge during the probe and will recommend arrests for any individuals identified but not initially named in the FIR.">
