    <meta name="description" content="A team of researchers at IIT-BHU has developed a 3D trimetallic nanodendrite-based electrochemical sensing device for highly sensitive and precise drug detection.  This device can detect even trace amounts of drugs in pharmaceutical formulations and milk samples.  

IIT-BHU holds a patent for the technology, with Prof Pranjal Chandra, Rohini Kumari, and Daphika S Dkhar as the inventors. The sensor offers advantages like excellent stability, fast response time, and a single-step modification process. 

This technology can be used to detect drug overdoses or adulteration in food samples, addressing the issue of antibiotic resistance and contamination concerns.">
