    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Congress Rebuilds in UP, Eyes 2027 Assembly Win</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Congress is rebuilding in Uttar Pradesh with a focus on reaching out to OBC communities, particularly the Most Backward Classes (MBCs).  Avinash Pande, the UP in-charge, says the party aims to complete its reorganization by August 15th. This involves identifying 23 lakh party workers and potential candidates at all levels, from booth to Assembly. 

While the Congress will contest upcoming Panchayat, Nagar Parishad, and Nagar Palika elections alone, Pande asserts that an alliance with the Samajwadi Party (SP) for the 2027 Assembly elections is in place.  He emphasizes that the Congress is prepared to contest all 403 Assembly seats.">
