    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BrahMos Rain: UP-Made Missiles Strike Pakistan</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath confirmed that BrahMos missiles, produced at a new facility in Lucknow, were used in India's retaliatory strikes against Pakistan following the Pahalgam terror attack. 

Fifteen BrahMos missiles, travelling at 3,600 kmph, hit 11 of Pakistan's 13 major airbases, significantly damaging their air defence network and military infrastructure. The strikes were a demonstration of India's growing military power and  UP's role in defence manufacturing.

BrahMos, a long-range supersonic cruise missile jointly developed by India and Russia, features advanced guidance technology, stealth capabilities, and can carry warheads of up to 300 kg.  Its production in UP is part of India's 'Make in India' and 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiatives.">
