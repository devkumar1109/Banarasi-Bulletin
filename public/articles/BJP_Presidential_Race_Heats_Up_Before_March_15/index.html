    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BJP Presidential Race Heats Up Before March 15</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is likely to announce its new national president within two weeks, potentially before March 15.  Organizational elections in 12 states have concluded, prompting leadership changes. BJP in-charges have been asked to submit potential candidates. 

Elections in key states like Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Assam have finished. Bihar is expected to retain its current leadership. This follows the recent extension of J.P. Nadda's tenure until June 2024 and his inclusion in the government. The party aims to make the announcement before March 15, as an inauspicious period begins soon after in the Hindu calendar.">
