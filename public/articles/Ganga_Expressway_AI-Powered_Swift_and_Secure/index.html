    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Ganga Expressway: AI-Powered, Swift, and Secure</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Ganga Expressway, connecting Meerut and Prayagraj, is nearing completion and expected to be inaugurated in November 2025. The expressway, estimated to cost Rs 36,230 crore, will significantly reduce travel time between the two cities to six hours.  

The Indian Air Force successfully conducted nighttime combat drills involving Rafale, Sukhoi, and Mirage jets on the expressway's airstrip in Shahjahanpur.  

To ensure road quality and minimize accident risks, the Uttar Pradesh government is using Swiss AI and sensor technology from ETH Zurich and RTDT Labs.  This technology detects road defects during construction, allowing for immediate repairs and ensuring driver safety and comfort.  UPEIDA plans to implement this technology on the Gorakhpur Link Expressway as well.">
