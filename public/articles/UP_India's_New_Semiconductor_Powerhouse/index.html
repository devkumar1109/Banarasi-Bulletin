    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP: India's New Semiconductor Powerhouse</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh is rapidly becoming a major hub for semiconductor manufacturing in India.  

Two significant projects have been approved: a ₹3,706 crore joint venture between HCL and Foxconn to build a display driver chip plant near Jewar airport, and a ₹27,000 crore proposal by Tarq Semiconductors, a Hiranandani Group venture, for an integrated circuit fabrication unit in Noida.  

The state government's Semiconductor Policy-2024, launched in February 2024, offers incentives like capital subsidies, land discounts, and stamp duty exemptions to attract investors.  

This initiative aligns with the vision of making Uttar Pradesh a cornerstone of Digital India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat. Uttar Pradesh already contributes significantly to India’s mobile phone and component production, providing a strong foundation for growth in the semiconductor sector.">
