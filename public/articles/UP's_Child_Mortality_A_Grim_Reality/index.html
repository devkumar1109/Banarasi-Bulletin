    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP's Child Mortality: A Grim Reality</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh has the second highest child mortality rate in India, with 43 deaths per 1,000 births, according to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's 2024-25 Annual Health Report. The infant mortality rate (IMR) is 38 per 1,000 live births, and the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) is 28 per 1,000.  

These figures are significantly higher than the national averages of IMR at 28 and NMR at 20.  

Unsafe deliveries are a major contributor to child deaths, with infections like neonatal sepsis being a leading cause. 

Government initiatives like Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) and Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) aim to promote institutional deliveries and provide free healthcare for newborns.  



The government has also established Newborn Care Corners (NBCCs) in delivery facilities to strengthen newborn care infrastructure.">
