    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Cold Fogging: New Hope for Dengue and Malaria Fight</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A cold fogging trial to combat dengue and malaria is underway in Varanasi. Led by Chief Development Officer Himanshu Nagpal, the technique is being implemented in all village panchayats and wards.  

The trial, conducted in Prime Minister's Model Village Kurhua, used insecticide mixed with water to produce a mist instead of smoke, minimizing environmental pollution associated with traditional diesel-based fogging. This method will be used in 45 houses near dengue patients and in sensitive village panchayats.  

The District Malaria Officer noted the potential of cold fogging for preventive action against dengue cases during the infection period and its future application in hospitals.">
