    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - One Nation, One Election: 2034 Target</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath believes simultaneous elections in India could become a reality by 2034. He advocates for a mass awareness campaign promoting "one nation, one election" and argues that it will lead to political stability, benefiting development.  

Adityanath claims simultaneous elections would save Rs 3.5 to 4.5 lakh crore annually by reducing election expenses. He suggests adjusting assembly tenures to achieve this. He asserts that those prioritizing national interests will support the move.  

Simultaneous elections were conducted between 1952 and 1967 before ending due to a Congress split, leading to instability. Adityanath states a roadmap is being developed based on the committee headed by former President Ram Nath Kovind and public awareness.">
