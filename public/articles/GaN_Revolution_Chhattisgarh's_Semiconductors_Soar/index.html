Developed by Polymatech Electronics Limited with a ₹1,143 crore investment, the plant will commence commercial production in April-May 2026.  

The facility will manufacture high-frequency GaN chips for 5G and 6G telecommunications infrastructure, aiming to produce 10 billion chips annually by 2030. The plant is expected to create thousands of direct jobs and lakhs of indirect employment opportunities, attract FDI, and boost regional economic development. 

Polymatech will also handle advanced packaging of the chips at the Raipur facility, which will serve as a hub for innovation in RF systems, defense electronics, AI, data analytics, and high-performance computing. GaN is recognized globally as a superior alternative to silicon for high-power, high-frequency applications.">
