    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - India's Prisons: Overcrowded and Neglected</title>
    <meta name="description" content="India's prisons are facing a severe crisis due to overcrowding, lack of healthcare, and insufficient mental health support.  Overcrowding rates exceed 131%, with some prisons operating at over 400% capacity.  The India Justice Report 2025 highlights that Uttar Pradesh's Moradabad District Prison is the most overcrowded at 497%. 

The prison population has risen from 3.8 lakh to 5.7 lakh between 2012 and 2022, while capacity has not kept pace. Projections indicate a prison population of 6.8 lakh by 2030, with only 5.15 lakh available spaces.

Healthcare resources are severely lacking, with a national average of one doctor for every 775 inmates, far exceeding the recommended standard of one doctor for every 300 prisoners.  Mental health support is also inadequate, with only 25 psychologists for the entire prison population, translating to one psychologist for every 22,928 prisoners.">
