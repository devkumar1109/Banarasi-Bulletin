    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Fogs Up Against Dengue, Malaria</title>
    <meta name="description" content="To combat dengue and malaria in Varanasi, the health department is implementing cold fogging in all village panchayats and wards. 

A successful trial of cold fogging was conducted in Prime Minister's Model Village Kurhua. This method uses insecticide mixed with water to produce mist, unlike thermal fogging which uses diesel and creates smoke.

Cold fogging will be used in 45 houses around dengue patients and in sensitive village panchayats. It is considered more environmentally friendly and will be used in hospitals and hot spot areas during the infection period.">
