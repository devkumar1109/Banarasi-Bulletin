    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - India's Smart Cities: Progress, Delays, and Funding</title>
    <meta name="description" content="India's Smart Cities Mission, launched in 2015, aimed to transform 100 cities by improving urban infrastructure and quality of life.  The deadline for project completion was extended to March 31, 2025. As of the deadline, only 18 cities have fully implemented their projects, with Agra, Varanasi, Madurai, Coimbatore, Udaipur, Pune, Surat, and Vadodara being among them.  

While 7% of projects remain incomplete, the mission shows progress with 93% completed. Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh lead with five and four completed cities respectively, while Telangana lags behind with only 64% of projects finished. Several North Eastern states, including Manipur, Mizoram, and Arunachal Pradesh, also face challenges in project completion and fund utilization. 

The central government allocated Rs 48,000 crore, with an equal amount expected from states and urban local bodies.  Around Rs 1.5 trillion has been spent on smart city projects, with Rs 60,000 crore raised through PPPs, bonds, and government resources.">
