Major recruitment drives occurred in 2020 with 49,568 personnel joining, including 5,966 women, and in 2024 with 8,362 sub-inspectors and equivalent ranks, including 1,618 women sub-inspectors. UP Police also made history with the largest-ever sports quota recruitment in 2024. 

A new recruitment drive is planned to fill 28,138 vacancies, including 4,543 sub-inspector and 22,053 constable positions, further bolstering field-level policing in both urban and rural areas.">
