    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Gorkha Drones: 3D-Printed Surveillance Takes Flight</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The 39 Gorkha Training Centre in Varanasi showcased lightweight, 3D-printed surveillance drones at the Surya Drona Tech-2025 event in Dehradun.  

These drones, designed and manufactured in-house, have a 10 km range, a 20-30 minute battery life, and VR capabilities, providing live feeds for ground troops. 

The use of 3D printing allows for quick replacement of broken parts.  The drones are currently for surveillance purposes only but the centre is also developing a wired drone to counter drone jamming technology.  

Another highlight of the event was an AI-enabled surveillance camera device named Noctvision, developed by a Gujarat-based firm, Optomized Electrotech. This device can identify individuals in crowds of up to 5 lakh people by analyzing facial bone dimensions.">
