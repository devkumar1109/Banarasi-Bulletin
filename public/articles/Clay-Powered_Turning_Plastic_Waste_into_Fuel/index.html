    <meta name="description" content="Researchers at IIT-BHU have developed an eco-friendly technology to convert plastic waste into fuel oil.  

Led by Prof. Hiralal Pramanik, the team created a patented multiphase catalytic pyrolysis reactor using natural catalysts synthesized from river clay. 

This process transforms plastics like polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene into diesel and kerosene-range fuel oils.  

This technology addresses Varanasi's plastic waste problem, which causes waterlogging, animal deaths, and environmental contamination. 

The solution has received an Indian patent and international recognition, and the team is now working on scaling it for commercial production.">
