    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BJP's UP Chief Hunt: Caste Calculus Delays Decision</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The BJP is facing a delay in appointing a new Uttar Pradesh state president, a position vacant since January 2023. The delay stems from internal caste dynamics and the party's need to recalibrate its strategy ahead of the 2027 Assembly elections. 

The Samajwadi Party's PDA alliance, which gained traction in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections by consolidating backward, Dalit, and minority communities, has challenged the BJP's position. To counter this, the BJP is considering candidates from the OBC and Dalit communities, but factionalism within these groups complicates the decision. 

National-level uncertainties, including the extension of BJP national president JP Nadda's tenure and the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir, further contribute to the delay. The BJP's recent decision to conduct a Caste census is seen as a counter-measure to the SP's PDA narrative, adding further weight to the significance of the state president appointment.">
