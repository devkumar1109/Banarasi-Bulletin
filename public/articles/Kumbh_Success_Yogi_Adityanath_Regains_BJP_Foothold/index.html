    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Kumbh Success: Yogi Adityanath Regains BJP Foothold</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj concluded on Wednesday, highlighting the organizational capacity of Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath.  Yogi's standing within the BJP had been questioned following the party's lackluster performance in the recent UP General Election.  

However, the successful execution of the Kumbh, a major Hindu pilgrimage, has solidified his position in saffron politics. The 45-day festival, which attracted over 66 crore pilgrims, was marred by a stampede on January 29 that claimed 30 lives.  

Despite this setback, the state government effectively managed the remaining events and addressed pilgrim needs.  High-profile attendees included President Droupadi Murmu, PM Narendra Modi, and CMs from BJP- and NDA-ruled states.">
