    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP BJP Trust for Banke Bihari Temple Sparks Row</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh has constituted a trust to manage the Banke Bihari temple in Mathura, sparking controversy.  Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav criticized the move, accusing the BJP of "indirectly controlling" temples under the guise of better administration. The Department of Religious Affairs, resurrected by Akhilesh Yadav during his tenure as CM, has gained prominence under Adityanath. 

Since 2017, Adityanath has established several development parishads for religious sites, including the Braj Teerth Vikas Parishad, which is fully operational.  Assistance for pilgrims undertaking the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra and Sindhu Darshan Yatra has also been increased. The move to establish a trust for the Banke Bihari temple echoes the development of the Kashi Vishwanath corridor in Varanasi.">
