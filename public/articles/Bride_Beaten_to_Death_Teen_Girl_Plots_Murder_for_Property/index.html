    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Bride Beaten to Death, Teen Girl Plots Murder for Property</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A 26-year-old woman named Aarti Pal was allegedly beaten to death by her 44-year-old husband, Raju Pal, in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, just one week after their marriage. The couple had reportedly been clashing frequently, and the violence escalated on the night of May 16th, resulting in Aarti's death. Raju has been arrested, and Aarti's body has been sent for post-mortem.  

In a separate incident, a 13-year-old girl and two male friends have been arrested for the murder of the woman who raised her since infancy. The 54-year-old victim, Rajalaxmi Kar, was allegedly smothered to death on April 29th in Paralakhemundi. Police believe the girl plotted the murder with a temple priest and another man to gain control of her property and because the victim opposed her relationship with them.">
