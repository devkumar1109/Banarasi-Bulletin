    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BJP Unveils Uttar Pradesh District Presidents Online</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The BJP will announce new Uttar Pradesh district presidents online on Sunday, marking the first time the party will use this method.  The announcement will be made through live streaming and WhatsApp groups, with state headquarters monitoring the process. Each district office will hold a meeting at 2 pm where the district election officer will receive the name of the new president via WhatsApp and announce it.  The BJP expects to announce presidents for 87 of its 98 districts, with the remaining 11 elections pending.  

Around 50% of the district president positions are expected to be filled by OBCs, SCs/STs, and women, a move the party hopes will counter the Samajwadi Party's PDA (Pichhda, dalit, and alpsankhyak) campaign.  The BJP anticipates protests from dissatisfied candidates, as there were numerous nominations for previous organizational elections.">
