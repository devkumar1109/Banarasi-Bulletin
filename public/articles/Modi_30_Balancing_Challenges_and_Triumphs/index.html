    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Modi 3.0: Balancing Challenges and Triumphs</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In his second year of his third term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces challenges and opportunities. Despite winning fewer seats than expected in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP has managed to maintain its alliance with key regional parties like the TDP, JD(U), and LJP(RV).  

The RSS, while initially dissatisfied with the party's performance, has rallied behind Modi and the BJP, contributing to recent victories in Haryana, Maharashtra, and Delhi.  

The Pahalgam terror attack and the subsequent ceasefire with Pakistan have highlighted the complex dynamics of national security and international relations in Modi 3.0. The ceasefire, brokered by the US, faced criticism from the Right wing, forcing the BJP to navigate a delicate balance between appeasement and assertive nationalism.">
