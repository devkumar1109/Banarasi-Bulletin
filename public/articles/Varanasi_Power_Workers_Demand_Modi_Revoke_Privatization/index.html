    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Power Workers Demand Modi Revoke Privatization</title>
    <meta name="description" content="An electricity department employee 'Bijli Maha Panchayat' in Varanasi passed a proposal urging PM Modi to revoke the privatization of Purvanchal and Dakshinanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam. 

The proposal argues that privatization will triple electricity rates, citing higher rates in Mumbai compared to Uttar Pradesh.  

It cites Agra's AT&C losses and power purchase price discrepancies as evidence of exploitation under privatization. Despite protests and contractual agreements, many contract workers remain dismissed, further fueling discontent. 

The proposal demands the reinstatement of all dismissed contract workers, cancellation of privatization, and an end to forced smartphone use for facial attendance.">
