    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Uttar Pradesh: Silk Boom for Rural Empowerment</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh government aims to significantly increase silk production by 2025–26 by linking 7,500 rural groups to the State Rural Livelihood Mission.  

15 districts will receive support through training, technology, and financial assistance to empower silk producers. The initiative targets increased women's participation, with a goal of involving 50,000 women from 5,000 groups in silk production within five years. 

This drive, including the Mukhyamantri Resham Vikas Yojana, aims to make Uttar Pradesh self-reliant in silk production and boost exports. Currently, the state produces 400 metric tonnes of silk annually against a consumption of 3,500 metric tonnes.">
