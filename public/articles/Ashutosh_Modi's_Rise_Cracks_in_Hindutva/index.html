    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Ashutosh: Modi's Rise, Cracks in Hindutva</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Ashutosh, author of "Reclaiming Bharat," views Narendra Modi's rise as a "right-wing revolution" that disrupted India's constitutional consensus.  He compares the 2014 power shift from Manmohan Singh to Modi to India's independence in 1947, emphasizing its significance. 

Ashutosh argues that the 2024 election results show potential cracks in the BJP's Hindutva project. He believes the RSS remains dedicated to dismantling Gandhian and Nehruvian ideals in pursuit of a Hindu Rashtra.  "Reclaiming Bharat" is a sequel to Ashutosh's earlier book, "Hindu Rashtra," which analyzed the ideological framework of Modi's first term.">
