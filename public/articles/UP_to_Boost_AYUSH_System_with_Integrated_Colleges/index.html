    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered the establishment of integrated AYUSH colleges in every division of the state, offering Ayurveda, Unani, and Homoeopathy on a single campus. This aims to strengthen the AYUSH medical system and health-based education.  

Adityanath also mandated Naturopathy and Yoga Centres in all state institutions, and directed the time-bound filling of educational and medical posts in AYUSH institutions.  

He instructed the creation of health and wellness centres in every district, either government-run or through Public-Private Partnerships.  The Chief Minister emphasized promoting Panchakarma therapy in Ayurveda and encouraged private investment in the sector, urging quality assessment of private AYUSH institutions.  International Yoga Day preparations were reviewed, with Adityanath directing celebrations at all levels and ensuring trained yoga masters in each district.  MoUs with Ayurvedic medicine manufacturers like Dabur, Baidyanath, and Patanjali were also instructed to ensure regular medicine supply to AYUSH hospitals.">
