    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Nine Days to Freedom: Bride Elopes, Groom Relieved</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A 23-year-old man from Uttar Pradesh expressed relief after his wife eloped with her alleged lover just nine days after their marriage. Sunil reportedly said he was grateful the situation didn't turn fatal, comparing his experience to the case of Raja Raghuvanshi, who was allegedly murdered by his wife and her lover during their honeymoon.  The couple married on May 17th, and the wife stayed with her in-laws for nine days before going to her maternal home. Instead of returning, she fled with her alleged lover ten days later. Sunil filed a missing person report, and the wife eventually appeared at the Bisauli police station, stating her desire to live with her lover. Both families agreed to amicably end the marriage, returning gifts and valuables.">
