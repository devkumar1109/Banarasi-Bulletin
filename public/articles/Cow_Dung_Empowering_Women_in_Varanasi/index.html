    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Cow Dung: Empowering Women in Varanasi</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Rita Tiwari is empowering women in Varanasi through self-employment initiatives using cow dung and urine. Her project started in 2005 and now employs around 1,000 women who make products like lamps, incense sticks, statues, and cleaning supplies. 

Initially, women earned ₹2,000-₹4,000 per month but now earn ₹15,000-₹16,000 monthly.  The initiative was inspired by Ajit Mahapatra's work and training received in Deolapar.  Rita provides moulds and cow dung to these women who work from home.

Products are sold online through platforms like Trade India and Flipkart, generating a monthly turnover of around ₹10 lakh.">
