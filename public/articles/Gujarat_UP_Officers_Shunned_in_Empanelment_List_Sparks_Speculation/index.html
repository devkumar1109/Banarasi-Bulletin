    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Gujarat, UP Officers Shunned in Empanelment List Sparks Speculation</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The latest empanelment list for secretary-level posts in the Indian government excludes officers from Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, raising speculation.  Typically, two IAS batches are empaneled annually, but in 2024, only the 1993 batch was empaneled, with the 1994 batch awaiting a process that may not begin until next year.  This delay, coupled with the absence of officers from politically significant states, has fueled speculation about the government's intentions. 

Meanwhile, a CBI probe is underway into a land scam involving the Noida Sports City project, implicating 10 IAS officers and a former Noida Authority CEO. The scandal involves irregularities in land allocation,  issuance of occupancy certificates despite violations, and ignoring builder dues.">
