    <meta name="description" content="NSUI activists protested against RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat during his visit to Varanasi, demanding he practice what he preaches about Hindutva. They attempted to offer him Maha Kumbh water, highlighting his absence from the religious ritual and questioning his commitment to Sanatan tradition.  

The activists, led by Vikash Singh, tried to approach Bhagwat's convoy and shout slogans, leading to an altercation with the police who detained several youths.  They criticized Bhagwat for engaging in the politics of Hindutva but not practicing it, citing his absence from the Maha Kumbh as evidence.">
