    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Fights TB: New Tests Target High-Risk Groups</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Varanasi, new CY TB tests are being launched to detect TB infections among high-risk individuals as part of the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program.  

These tests will be conducted at hospitals for groups like those with silicosis, undergoing treatment like dialysis, chemotherapy, or anti-TNF, steroid and organ transplant recipients, diabetics, malnourished individuals, smokers, and alcohol consumers. Approximately 15,000 doses of CY TB have been allocated to the district. 

The CY TB test involves an intradermal injection and results are evaluated within 48-72 hours. Individuals with positive results will receive TB preventive treatment (TPT). The aim is to increase the annual decline in TB incidence rate from 2.5% to 10% and ultimately make the district TB-free.">
