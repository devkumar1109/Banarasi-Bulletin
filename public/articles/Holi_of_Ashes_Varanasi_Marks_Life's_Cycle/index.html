    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Holi of Ashes: Varanasi Marks Life's Cycle</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Masan Holi, a unique celebration involving playing Holi with ashes from funeral pyres, was observed at Varanasi's Manikarnika Ghat. The centuries-old tradition, symbolizing the cycle of life and death, took place on the day after Rangbhari Ekadashi.  A large crowd, including Sadhus and Aghoris, participated in the celebrations. For safety, security measures were implemented, including deployment of police forces and monitoring cameras. 

Meanwhile, other Holi celebrations were reported across India, including a 1700-year-old tradition with the Lord Shiva and Nandi procession in Jaipur's Sambhar and a 'Holi Milan' program in Delhi attended by several political leaders. Rangbhari Ekadashi was observed with devotion at Baba Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi and Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan.">
