    <meta name="description" content="On World Malaria Day (April 25th), Varanasi's health department organized fever screening camps in hotspot areas. The theme this year is 'Malaria ends with us: Reinvest, Reimagine, Reignite.'

Schools provided information about malaria prevention, and a special campaign is underway to control communicable diseases. Mosquito breeding sources are being destroyed in urban and rural areas. ASHA workers are inspecting homes for breeding conditions and eliminating them. 

In 2022, 69 malaria cases were found out of 1,16,536 tests. In 2023, 23 cases were found from 1,67,000 tests, and in 2024, only 13 cases were found from 2,29,000 tests.  Varanasi is implementing a four-level approach for malaria eradication, including door-to-door fever tracking, fever screening at OPDs, mass contact tracing, and weekly camps in hotspot areas.">
