    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi on High Alert After Leopard Attacks</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Following a leopard attack in Varanasi last week that injured three people, 12 villages along the Ganga river are on high alert.  The leopard, suspected to have entered Varanasi from Chandauli or the Kaimur Wildlife Sanctuary, evaded capture despite a search operation by forest department teams from Varanasi and Chandauli.  

The injured individuals are in stable condition.  Villagers in the 12 affected villages, with a combined population of around 18,000, are advised to exercise caution, particularly after dark. The forest department has implemented safety measures like deploying guards, installing nets and cages, and conducting combing operations.  Villagers are also taking their own precautions, keeping night vigils and using firecrackers to deter the leopard.">
