    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT BHU Wins Hackathon with Age-Telling Glycan Tech</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A team from IIT (BHU), Varanasi, won the Forensic Hackathon 2025 for developing a glycan-based forensic technology that accurately estimates age using biological fluids. 

The technology, led by Prof. Sumit Kumar Singh, uses glycomic profiling and machine learning to decode molecular signatures, offering insights into an individual's age and health. This method overcomes limitations of DNA-based age estimation, which can be inaccurate with degraded samples or diverse populations. 

The technology, which estimates both chronological and biological age, can provide valuable context in criminal investigations, helping narrow down suspects or understand an individual's health status at the time of an incident.">
