    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Neja Mela Blocked: History, Faith, and Politics Collide</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh government has denied permission for the annual Neja Mela in Sambhal district, citing objections from Hindu community members and public order concerns. 

The mela commemorates Syed Salar Masud Ghazi, the nephew of Mahmud of Ghazni, a historical figure known for invading and plundering Hindu temples. The Sambhal administration sealed the site traditionally used for the mela's inauguration and filled the ceremonial flagpole pit with cement.

This decision has sparked political debate, with some analysts suggesting it's a BJP strategy to counter the Samajwadi Party's focus on outreach to marginalized communities.">
