    <meta name="description" content="The family of an accused in the Varanasi gang rape case and a woman claiming to be the victim's friend dispute the survivor's allegations, calling them fabricated.  The friend alleges the victim previously expressed a desire for social freedom and outings, and didn't mention any assault during previous encounters. She also suggests the victim had pre-existing health issues unrelated to the alleged rape. The accused's sister claims the victim expressed interest in marrying her brother, but he was uninterested, leading to tension. Police haven't responded to these counterclaims.  Twelve accused, including Raj Vishwakarma, have been arrested. The investigation is ongoing.">
