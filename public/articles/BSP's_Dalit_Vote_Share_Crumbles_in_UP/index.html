    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BSP's Dalit Vote Share Crumbles in UP</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is experiencing a significant decline in Uttar Pradesh, leading to a battle for Dalit votes. The BSP's vote share dropped from over 30% in 2007 to 9.3% in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. This decline is attributed to internal power struggles and the exodus of senior leaders to the BJP, Congress, and Samajwadi Party (SP).  

Dalit votes are now divided among four major players: the BSP, BJP, SP, and Chandrashekhar Azad's Aazad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram). While the BSP still retains around 9% of Dalit votes, the remaining 14% are split between the BJP, SP, and ASP(KR). The 2024 Lok Sabha election saw a notable increase in Dalit votes going to the SP-Congress alliance after Akhilesh Yadav's "Pichchda, Dalit, Alpasankhyak" initiative.">
