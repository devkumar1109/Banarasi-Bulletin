    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Bans Roadside Prayers, Sparking Religious Row</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh government has prohibited the offering of Namaz on roads and rooftops during Alvida Jumma and Eid-ul-Fitr in several districts, citing public safety, traffic concerns, and accident prevention. 

The decision has drawn criticism from opposition leaders and some members of the Muslim community who view it as an infringement on religious practice, sparking a debate about the balance between law, faith, and politics. 

While authorities have arranged alternative prayer spaces, some worshippers express concerns about the limited capacity of these locations and the need for more inclusive solutions.  Strict security measures, including heavy police deployment, were implemented to enforce the restrictions during Alvida Jumma, the last Friday of Ramadan.">
