    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Healthcare: Yadav Blasts BJP's "Ruined" System</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav accused the BJP government of ruining healthcare in Uttar Pradesh. He claimed hospitals lack essential medicines, tests, and staff, with medical colleges lacking adequate facilities. 

Yadav alleged corruption in medicine and machine purchases and criticized the government for not building new district hospitals or improving existing ones. He pointed to incomplete medical college buildings, a lack of ambulances, and fire safety concerns in hospitals.

He further stated that the government's cancer hospital arrangements are in disarray and medical colleges face budget shortages and a lack of specialist doctors. Due to poor government hospitals, patients are forced to private facilities, where they are overcharged.">
