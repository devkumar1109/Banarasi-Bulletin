    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Arun Blasts Yadav for Divisive, Dalit-Insulting Politics</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh Minister Asim Arun accused Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav of divisive politics and alleged that Yadav humiliated Dalits during his tenure as chief minister. Arun claimed the public rejected this politics, leading to the SP's decline. He criticized Yadav for renaming districts and institutions named after Dalit icons, calling it an insult to social consciousness.  Arun also alleged that during the SP rule, SC/ST officers were denied postings, violating rules.  He contrasted this with the BJP government, claiming it prioritizes merit-based postings and has distributed record scholarships, benefiting 56 lakh students compared to 34 lakh under the SP government.">
