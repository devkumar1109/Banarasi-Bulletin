    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT-BHU's Drowning Detection: Swim Safe, Stay Alert.</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Researchers at IIT-BHU have developed a portable drowning monitoring system to protect swimmers and fishermen. The device uses real-time sensors to detect signs of drowning and sends alerts to nearby responders or mobile devices. 

The system monitors vital health metrics like heart rate, location, and depth. It stores user data for analysis and can be particularly helpful for vulnerable groups like children and the elderly. The technology, patented by IIT-BHU, is undergoing commercial trials with plans for large-scale deployment. This innovation aligns with the Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat initiatives.">
