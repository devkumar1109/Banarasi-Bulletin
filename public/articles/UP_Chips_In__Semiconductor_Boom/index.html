    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Chips In:  Semiconductor Boom</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh is rapidly becoming a key player in India's semiconductor mission with ₹30,000 crore investments. Two major projects are driving this growth:  a ₹3,706 crore joint venture between HCL and Foxconn near Jewar airport, focusing on display driver chips, and a ₹27,000 crore Tarc Semiconductor project in Noida, producing integrated circuits (ICs) and microchips.  

Uttar Pradesh launched its dedicated Semiconductor Policy 17 months ago, attracting significant investments. The state government offers attractive incentives, including up to 50% capital subsidy, 75% land discount, and 100% stamp duty exemption.  

These initiatives align with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's vision of making Uttar Pradesh a cornerstone of Digital India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat.">
