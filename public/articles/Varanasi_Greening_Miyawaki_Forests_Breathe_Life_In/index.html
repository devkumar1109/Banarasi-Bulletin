    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Greening: Miyawaki Forests Breathe Life In.</title>
    <meta name="description" content="To combat rising temperatures and pollution in Varanasi, the government is implementing a large-scale tree-planting campaign using the Japanese Miyawaki technique.  Three new forest areas are being developed, adding to the 5.617 hectares already established in nine locations.  

These "natural oxygen banks" aim to improve air quality and provide cleaner air. Programs like the National Clean Air Mission, forest fund financing, and municipal corporation financing support this initiative. Since 2020-21, 1,70,246 trees have been planted, transforming nine locations into dense forests.  New planting sites include the Ramna STP Plant, Banas Dairy Amul, and near Shankar Netralaya.  The Miyawaki method involves planting a mix of grass, herbs, shrubs, and trees of various sizes.">
