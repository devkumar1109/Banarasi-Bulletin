    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Trump-Musk Bill: Agency Annihilation on the Horizon</title>
    <meta name="description" content="H.R. 1295, promoted by President Trump and Elon Musk with Republican support, aims to grant them the authority to dismantle federal agencies and cut programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  

The bill, dubbed the "Dismantling Government Act" by Ranking Member Gerald E. Connolly, bypasses Congress's usual oversight and raises concerns about its potential impact on millions. Republicans acknowledge that Trump and Musk lack legal authority to remove agencies or programs without congressional approval. 

H.R. 1295 revives a long-dormant law from 1932 to 1984, previously used for limited reorganizations, and expands its scope without safeguards. It grants Trump and Musk unprecedented power to eliminate departments and agencies, potentially bypassing the filibuster and requiring only a simple majority vote in Congress.">
