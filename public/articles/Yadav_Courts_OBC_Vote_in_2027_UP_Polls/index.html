    <meta name="description" content="Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav is focusing on the OBC vote base in his campaign for the 2027 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. He has made several promises aimed at this community, including installing a statue of Raja Suheldev, a revered OBC figure, at the Gomti riverfront in Lucknow. The SP aims to counter the BJP's dominance over the OBC vote, which has been a key factor in the BJP's electoral success in UP. Akhilesh's promises, including increased representation for disadvantaged groups, are part of the SP's strategy to build a coalition of OBCs, Dalits, and Adivasis.">
