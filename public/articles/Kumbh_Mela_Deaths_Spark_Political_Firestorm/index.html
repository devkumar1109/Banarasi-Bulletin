    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Kumbh Mela: Deaths Spark Political Firestorm</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Mahakumbh Mela in Prayagraj, which concluded on February 26, saw three stampede incidents resulting in deaths. 

Mamata Banerjee criticized the BJP government for inadequate arrangements, calling it a "Mrityu Kumbh" (death Kumbh).

Modi also accused "a group of leaders" of mocking religion, while Yogi Adityanath called those criticizing the event "vultures". 

The BJP has used the Kumbh as a propaganda tool, elevating its significance beyond a religious event. Other political parties are struggling to counter this.">
