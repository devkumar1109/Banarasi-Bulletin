    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Yogi on Namaz: Roads for Traffic, Discipline from Kumbh</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath defended his administration's warning against offering namaz on streets, stating roads are for traffic. He urged Muslims to learn religious discipline from Hindus during the Kumbh Mela, citing its peaceful conduct. Adityanath criticized Waqf boards, calling them dens of selfish interests and accusing them of neglecting Muslim welfare. He praised Hindu temples for their charitable work and questioned the lack of similar initiatives by Waqf boards despite their substantial property holdings.  He refuted claims of discrimination against Muslims, highlighting their significant share in government welfare schemes. Adityanath defended the "bulldozer model" for quick justice, stating it's necessary for removing encroachments and creating infrastructure.  He insisted the warning against namaz on roads was justified and criticized those opposing it for lacking discipline.">
