    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Gang Rape: Accusations, CCTV, and Contradictions</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A 19-year-old woman in Varanasi alleged she was gang-raped by 23 people between March 29 and April 4.  14 of the accused have been arrested. The victim's family filed a complaint on April 6. The accused's families claim the victim demanded money to omit names from the complaint and question why she didn't seek help during the alleged assault. CCTV footage reportedly shows the woman riding a bike during the alleged period, and her initial naming of 23 individuals but identifying only nine in court testimony raises concerns about potential manipulation. Police Commissioner Mohit Agarwal has formed an SIT to investigate both the allegations and counterclaims, with a 30-day deadline for a comprehensive report. PM Modi, briefed on the case, directed officials to take the "strictest possible action" against the guilty.  The survivor's mother expressed distress over her daughter's trauma and desire for justice.">
