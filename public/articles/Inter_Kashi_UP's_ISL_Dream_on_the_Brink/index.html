    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Inter Kashi: UP's ISL Dream on the Brink</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Varanasi-based club Inter Kashi is on the verge of winning the I-League and securing promotion to the Indian Super League (ISL). 

The club, founded in 2023, faces a potential title delay due to an alleged ineligible player in one of their matches. Regardless, Inter Kashi marks the first UP-based club with a chance to reach the ISL. 

President Prithiijit Das believes the state's large population and GDP present an opportunity to change football's perception in the region.

The club has attracted significant talent, including English professional Peter Hartley and coach Antonio Habas, the most successful coach in ISL history. Habas was drawn to Inter Kashi's "honest and transparent approach" and "clear vision."">
