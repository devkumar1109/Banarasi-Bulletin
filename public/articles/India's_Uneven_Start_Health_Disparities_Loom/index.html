    <meta name="description" content="World Health Day 2025 focuses on "Healthy Beginnings, Hopeful Futures," highlighting disparities in maternal and newborn health in India. While national progress has been made, significant regional differences persist. Kerala has a Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) of 30 per 100,000 live births, while Uttar Pradesh and Assam exceed 150 per 100,000.  Neonatal Mortality Rates (NMR) are below 10 per 1,000 live births in Tamil Nadu but surpass 30 per 1,000 in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. 

Inequalities stem from healthcare infrastructure gaps, workforce shortages, and nutritional deficiencies. Robust healthcare systems in Kerala and Tamil Nadu contribute to better maternal health outcomes. Conversely, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar face chronic deficiencies in facilities and personnel. 

Challenges include inadequate immunization rates, particularly in tribal areas, and geographic barriers impacting access to care, especially in northeastern states.">
