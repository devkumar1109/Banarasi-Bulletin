    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Shah in Chennai: BJP Seeks AIADMK Alliance</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Union Home Minister Amit Shah's visit to Chennai is crucial for the BJP as they aim to revive their alliance with the AIADMK ahead of next year's Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. The AIADMK is reportedly demanding the CM candidate be from their party, final decision-making power over the alliance, and no interference in their internal matters. Shah will meet with state BJP functionaries and RSS ideologue S Gurumurthy during his visit. 

Meanwhile, PM Modi will be in Varanasi and Madhya Pradesh. Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj party will hold a rally in Patna, and S Jaishankar will address India's Global Technology Summit in Delhi.  The BJP faces a significant challenge in Tamil Nadu from the DMK, which has opposed the party's brand of cultural nationalism.">
