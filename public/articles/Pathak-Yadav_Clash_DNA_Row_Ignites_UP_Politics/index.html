    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Pathak-Yadav Clash: DNA Row Ignites UP Politics</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A war of words has erupted between Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Brajesh Pathak and Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav.  

Pathak accused the SP of having a "DNA" linked to "Muslim appeasement" and "mafia nexus," prompting an angry response from the SP's official X handle targeting Pathak personally. This led to an FIR against the handler and widespread protests by BJP workers.

Akhilesh Yadav condemned the derogatory remarks made by his party's media cell and assured that such incidents would not recur. He however, criticized Pathak's statements as hurting religious sentiments and called for an end to such divisive rhetoric. Pathak clarified that his "DNA" comment referred to the SP's political ideology rooted in casteism and appeasement, alleging it was detrimental to Dalits.

The spat has intensified political maneuvering in the state, with both parties vying for the support of  Dalits and Brahmins ahead of the 2027 Assembly polls.">
