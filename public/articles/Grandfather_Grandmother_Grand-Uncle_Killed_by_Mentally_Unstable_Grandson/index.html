    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Grandfather, Grandmother, Grand-Uncle Killed by Mentally Unstable Grandson</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A 24-year-old man, suspected to be mentally unstable, killed his grandfather Kuber Maurya, grandmother Draupadi, and grand-uncle Sadhu Maurya in Jhangha, Gorakhpur, with a spade.  The incident occurred after the man attacked a buffalo, prompting his grandfather to intervene. The accused then pursued his victims into fields and fatally struck them. 

Police recovered the spade and arrested Ram Dayal.  The family has a history of mental health issues; Kuber received psychiatric care in the 1990s and his son, recently released from prison for molestation, also exhibited mental health concerns.  Ram Dayal had displayed aggressive behavior in the past, including brandishing a sharp object in the village.  Post-mortem examinations and forensic analysis are underway.">
