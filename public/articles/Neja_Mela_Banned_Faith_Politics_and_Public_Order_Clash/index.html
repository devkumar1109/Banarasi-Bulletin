    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Neja Mela Banned: Faith, Politics, and Public Order Clash</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Sambhal administration in Uttar Pradesh has banned the annual Neja Mela, a fair commemorating Syed Salar Masud Ghazi, the nephew of Mahmud of Ghazni. The decision cites objections from the Hindu community and concerns over public order.  The administration sealed the site traditionally used for the mela's inauguration, filling the ceremonial flagpole pit with cement.  

Syed Salar Masud Ghazi is known for his role in the invasion and plunder of Hindu temples, including the Somnath temple. Some analysts view the ban as a BJP strategy to counter the Samajwadi Party's outreach to marginalized communities.">
