    <meta name="description" content="The recent controversy in Uttar Pradesh over the use of Urdu in the Assembly highlights a long-standing historical conflict surrounding language and identity in India.  

During the colonial era, Urdu was classified as a "Muslim language," contributing to the communalization of linguistic identities. This legacy persists today, with Urdu often wrongly associated solely with Muslim identity, despite its deep roots in North India's literary and cultural traditions. 

The controversy reflects a broader political trend of using language as a tool to divide and manipulate communities. While Urdu evolved from a shared linguistic heritage, political rhetoric frequently frames it as a symbol of exclusivity rather than inclusivity.">
