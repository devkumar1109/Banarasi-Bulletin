    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - "Wrecking the Wedding Bell Blues: Bulldozers Crash Indian Nuptials as Symbol of Political Devotion"</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Here is a 150-word summary of the article:

In Uttar Pradesh, India, some couples are incorporating bulldozers into their wedding processions as a symbol of support for Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's demolition drive. This trend is seen in cities like Jhansi and Gorakhpur, where decorated bulldozers are part of the wedding procession, often adorned with flowers and balloons. The gesture is a nod to Adityanath's controversial use of bulldozers to demolish properties linked to alleged criminals, particularly in Muslim-majority areas. The Supreme Court had halted such demolitions last year, but the trend continues. Critics argue that the use of bulldozers in wedding processions reinforces a divisive symbol associated with coercive tactics against minorities and political adversaries. Despite criticism, many see the bulldozer as a symbol of power and influence. This trend is not unique to Uttar Pradesh, with similar stunts seen elsewhere, including a controversial display in the US during India Day Parade 2022.">
