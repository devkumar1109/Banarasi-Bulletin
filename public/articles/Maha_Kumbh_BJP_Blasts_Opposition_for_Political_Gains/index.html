    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Maha Kumbh: BJP Blasts Opposition for Political Gains</title>
    <meta name="description" content="BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi accused the opposition of seeking political gain from the Maha Kumbh tragedy, citing Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav's questioning of the death toll. Trivedi criticized Yadav's past skepticism towards COVID-19 vaccines, the Ram Lalla consecration, and now the Maha Kumbh deaths, saying he prioritizes political satisfaction over sensitivity.  

Trivedi also condemned opposition remarks like "Mrityu Kumbh," linking them to efforts to eradicate Sanatan Dharma in Tamil Nadu and dismantle global Hinduism. He praised the successful organization of Maha Kumbh in UP, highlighting its economic and cultural impact.  

He further criticized the opposition's stance on the US deporting illegal Indian immigrants, accusing them of opposing India's efforts to tackle illegal immigration and viewing Bangladeshi immigrants as a vote bank.">
