    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi's Pink Hues: Gulabi Meenakari Blossoms</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Gulabi Meenakari, Varanasi's pink enameling art, is experiencing a revival thanks to GI tag recognition in 2015 and ODOP status in 2018.  

The annual business of this traditional craft is now estimated at Rs 12-15 crore, employing around 250-300 people, 30% of whom are women.
