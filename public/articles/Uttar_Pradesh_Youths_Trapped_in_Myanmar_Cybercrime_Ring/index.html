    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Uttar Pradesh Youths Trapped in Myanmar Cybercrime Ring</title>
    <meta name="description" content="21 youths from Uttar Pradesh were deported from Myanmar after being tricked into participating in cybercrime operations. They were lured with promises of high-paying jobs in Thailand through Telegram by agents posing as recruiters.  

After undergoing a fake recruitment process, they were taken to K K Park in Myawaddy, Myanmar, a known cybercrime hub. Their passports were confiscated, and they were forced to engage in scams involving impersonating police officers and executing fake "digital arrest" schemes. 

Those who resisted were subjected to violence, imprisonment, and starvation. The gang demanded a $5,000 ransom if they refused to cooperate. 
The youths were trained to use WhatsApp, VOIP calls, and social media for scams targeting victims in the USA, Canada, Australia, and India. They were also instructed to create fake profiles of attractive women to lure high-profile targets into investment schemes.">
