    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - High Court Blasts Police Inaction in Abduction Cases</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Allahabad High Court criticized police inaction in abduction cases, warning that officers could be held personally responsible if a missing person dies due to negligence. The court was hearing a case where a man has been missing since March 31, 2025, allegedly abducted in Varanasi.  

The court expressed concern over the police's tendency to project a larger-than-life image and evade public accountability.  They noted a disturbing trend of missing persons going untraced, with the FIR in this case registered on April 3, 2025, but the victim still missing as of June 4, 2025.  

The court directed the Commissioner of Police, Varanasi, to personally file an affidavit by June 12, 2025, explaining the delay in recovering the missing individual.">
