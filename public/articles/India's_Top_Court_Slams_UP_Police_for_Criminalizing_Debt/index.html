    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - India's Top Court Slams UP Police for "Criminalizing Debt"</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Supreme Court of India criticized the Uttar Pradesh Police for repeatedly converting civil suits into criminal cases. Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna labeled this practice "absurd" and a "complete breakdown of rule of law," stating that failing to pay money should not be considered a criminal offense. 

The criticism stemmed from a money-related dispute where the police filed a chargesheet seeking to transform a civil case into a criminal one. The petitioner alleged that bribes influenced this decision. 

The Supreme Court stayed the criminal prosecution and directed the Investigating Officer to appear in court and justify the charges. The court also warned the Uttar Pradesh Police of facing costs if similar petitions are filed again.  



This is not the first time the Chief Justice has raised concerns about this practice, highlighting its unnecessary burden on the judicial system.">
