    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Patna's Metro: Speed, Politics, and Future Growth</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Patna is set to inaugurate its first metro line on August 15, covering five stations and 6 km.  This comes ahead of Bihar's assembly elections at the end of the year, with plans for further lines in Muzaffarpur, Gaya, Darbhanga, and Bhagalpur. Patna's rapid growth, ranking 21st fastest globally between 2006-2020, fueled the demand for improved transportation.  While politically beneficial, the metro's cost-effectiveness is debated, with concerns about short lines and low ridership in smaller cities.  Experts emphasize the need for integrated transport systems, including buses, alongside metro development.">
