    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Sawant: Waqf Bill Fuels Hindu-Muslim Divide</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Arvind Sawant alleges the Centre's proposed Waqf Act amendments aim to create a "Hindu-Muslim narrative" and benefit Hindus at the expense of Muslims. Sawant criticized panel chairman Jagdambika Pal, accusing him of dictatorial functioning and ignoring Opposition concerns. He claimed the panel invited RSS and Vanvasi Ashram representatives, not to facilitate discussion, but to oppose the Waqf board's land holdings. Sawant further criticized the government's decision to nominate members to the Waqf board instead of conducting elections, potentially resulting in a non-Muslim majority. The Opposition plans to vehemently oppose the Bill in Parliament.">
