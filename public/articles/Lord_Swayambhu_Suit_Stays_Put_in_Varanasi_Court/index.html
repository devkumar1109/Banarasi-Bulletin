    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Lord Swayambhu Suit Stays Put in Varanasi Court</title>
    <meta name="description" content="On Friday, a Varanasi District Court dismissed a plea seeking to transfer the Lord Swayambhu suit from the court of the civil judge senior division to the district court. Anushka Tiwari and Indu Tiwari, representing Jyotirlinga Adi Vishweshwar Virajman, filed the transfer application in September 2024.  

They argued that the suit, along with seven similar cases, had been consolidated after being withdrawn from various courts. However, the opposing parties objected, stating that the applicants were not parties to the suit and thus, the transfer application was not valid.  The court upheld this objection, dismissing the application and stating that only parties to the suit can file for its transfer.">
