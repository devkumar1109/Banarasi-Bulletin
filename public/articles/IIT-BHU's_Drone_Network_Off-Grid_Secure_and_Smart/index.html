    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT-BHU's Drone Network: Off-Grid, Secure, and Smart</title>
    <meta name="description" content="IIT-BHU in Varanasi has developed a drone-based communication system that enables image and message sharing without internet connectivity. The system, called SSTM, utilizes autonomous drones to relay data over long distances, even in areas lacking communication infrastructure. 

Led by Prof. Hari Prabhat Gupta, the team created a self-sustaining transmission mechanism allowing real-time communication in remote, obstructed, or high-interference regions.  The drone network adapts to terrain and movement, making it suitable for defense, border surveillance, and disaster response. 

The system, funded by TII-UAE, IDAPT-Hub Foundation, and SERB, is scalable, low-cost, and intelligent, with potential applications in national security, emergency rescue, and off-grid scenarios. Future developments include integrating AI for autonomous drone path optimization and encryption for secure transmissions.">
