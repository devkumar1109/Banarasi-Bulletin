While the cause of death cannot be definitively confirmed without testing, the district health authorities are treating it as a rabies case and have launched a preventive campaign. This includes distributing anti-rabies vaccines and urging the public to seek immediate medical attention after any animal bite. The incident highlights a lack of awareness and access to post-bite care in rural areas.">
