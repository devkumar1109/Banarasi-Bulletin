    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh is set to implement new building construction bylaws called the "Uttar Pradesh Building Construction and Development Byelaws 2025."  

Key changes include deregulation for smaller residential and commercial buildings (up to 100 sq meters and 30 sq meters respectively), where plot registration will suffice for construction.  

The bylaws also propose a "Trust Based Online Approval" system for building plans in sanctioned layouts, prepared by licensed professionals.  

Further, height restrictions will be relaxed for certain buildings, and specific timelines for No Objection Certificates (NOCs) will be established. Public suggestions are currently being accepted, and the bylaws are expected to come into force soon.">
