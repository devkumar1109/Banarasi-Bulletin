    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Gang Rape: Truth, Allegations, and Justice Sought</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A 19-year-old woman in Varanasi alleged she was gang-raped by 23 people over six days, between March 29 and April 4.  The survivor's family filed a complaint on April 6, leading to the arrest of 14 of the 23 accused.  

The families of some accused claim the woman demanded money to remove names from the complaint and question why she didn't seek help during the alleged assaults. They cite CCTV footage showing her riding a bike during the alleged timeframe and allege inconsistencies in her account of the events.

A Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been formed to examine both the survivor's allegations and the counterclaims made by the accused's families. The SIT is expected to submit a comprehensive report within 30 days.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi, briefed on the case, has directed officials to take the "strictest possible action" against those found guilty.">
