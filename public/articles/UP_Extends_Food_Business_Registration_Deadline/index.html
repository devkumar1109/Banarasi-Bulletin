Launched by the Food Safety and Drug Administration (FSDA) in April, the initiative requires all food businesses to register and obtain licenses to ensure compliance with the Food Safety and Standards Act.

After May 31st, strict action, including business closure, will be taken against non-compliant establishments.">
