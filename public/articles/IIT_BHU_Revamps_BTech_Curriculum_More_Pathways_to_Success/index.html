    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT BHU Revamps BTech Curriculum: More Pathways to Success</title>
    <meta name="description" content="IIT BHU is revising its BTech curriculum from 2025-26, aligning with NEP 2020. Students will have five academic pathways from the fourth semester: Regular BTech, BTech (Honours), BTech with a Minor, BTech with a Second Major, and BTech with MTech.

Minors allow students to take 4-6 courses in another discipline, while Second Majors extend the program to 10 semesters, granting degrees in two fields.  

Students can also pursue Integrated Dual Degree (IDD) for a BTech and MTech within 10 semesters. The branch-change system is discontinued, replaced by adding a Minor or Second Major.  

A sixth-semester internship is mandatory, and a Multiple Exit Framework allows students to leave with certificates after one, two, or three years.

IIT BHU is also launching an M.Tech in Medical Devices, AI-based industry courses, and a standards-focused course.">
