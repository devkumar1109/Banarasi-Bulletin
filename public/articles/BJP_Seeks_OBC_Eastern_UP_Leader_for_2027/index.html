    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BJP Seeks OBC Eastern UP Leader for 2027</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The BJP is delaying the appointment of its new Uttar Pradesh state president, searching for an Other Backward Class (OBC) leader from eastern UP. This decision is driven by the Samajwadi Party's focus on OBC, Dalit, and minority (PDA) voters.  

The BJP wants to balance caste and regional equations, especially as the next state president will lead them in the 2027 Assembly polls. Choosing an eastern UP leader could help mitigate the party's losses in the region during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.

Currently, the BJP relies on allies like Apna Dal (S), NISHAD Party, SBSP, and RLD to garner OBC votes. The appointment of 70 out of 98 district and city unit chiefs paves the way for the state president announcement.">
