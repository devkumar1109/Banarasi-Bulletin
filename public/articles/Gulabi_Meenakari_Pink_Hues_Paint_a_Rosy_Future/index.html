    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Gulabi Meenakari: Pink Hues Paint a Rosy Future</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Varanasi's Gulabi Meenakari, a pink enameling craft, is experiencing a revival thanks to its GI tag and ODOP (One District One Product) status. The craft, which was facing declining demand and counterfeit products, now boasts an annual business of Rs 12-15 crore, employing around 250-300 people, 30% of whom are women.  

Government initiatives, including training, loans, grants, and marketing efforts, have played a crucial role in reviving the art form.  Young artisans are returning to the craft, and orders are pouring in from both domestic and international markets, particularly for women's jewelry and corporate gifts.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath have also promoted Gulabi Meenakari on a global stage.">
