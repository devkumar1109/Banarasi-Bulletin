    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Surges Past Delhi in New Company Registrations</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh has surpassed Delhi in new company registrations during the first 10 months of the fiscal year 2024-25.  UP registered 15,590 new companies compared to Delhi's 12,759, trailing only Maharashtra with around 21,000 new companies.  

This surge in registrations signifies investor confidence in UP's growth prospects, attributed to factors like strong economic growth, a large consumer base, ease of doing business initiatives, and improved law and order. 

Despite the increase in new companies, Delhi still leads UP in the number of "active" or operational companies, with 2,50,162 compared to UP's 1,50,703. 


However, UP has overtaken West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka to become the third largest state in terms of operational companies, behind Maharashtra and Delhi.">
