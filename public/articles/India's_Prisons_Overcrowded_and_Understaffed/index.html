    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - India's Prisons: Overcrowded and Understaffed</title>
    <meta name="description" content="India's prisons are severely overcrowded, with a national occupancy rate exceeding 131% and over 55% of prisons operating above capacity in 2022.   Some prisons are at over 400% capacity, notably Uttar Pradesh’s Moradabad District Prison at 497% occupancy.  The prison population has surged from 3.8 lakh to 5.7 lakh between 2012 and 2022, while capacity has not kept pace. 

Medical care in prisons is inadequate, with a national average of one doctor for every 775 prisoners, far exceeding the recommended 1:300 ratio.  Many states, including Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have a doctor-to-inmate ratio of 1:1000 or worse.  There is also a severe shortage of psychologists, with only 25 serving the entire prison population, an average of 1 for every 22,928 prisoners.">
