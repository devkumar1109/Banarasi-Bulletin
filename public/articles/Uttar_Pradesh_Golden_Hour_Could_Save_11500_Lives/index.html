    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Uttar Pradesh: Golden Hour Could Save 11,500 Lives</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh sees around 23,000 annual road accident deaths, half of which could be prevented with timely medical aid within the "golden hour" (first hour after an incident). Medical experts emphasize the importance of basic care like stabilizing the neck and spine, clearing airways, and rapid transport to the hospital.  
 
Timely treatment within 3-4 hours can reduce stroke mortality by 40% and immediate CPR and defibrillation within 10 minutes can significantly improve survival chances for heart attack victims. While the 108 ambulance service plays a role, ensuring "golden hour" treatment remains a challenge.  Strengthening trauma care at community and primary health centers is crucial, along with addressing delays in recognizing emergency symptoms and lack of trained personnel.">
