    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - India Digitizes Crops: DCS Aims for 2025 Nationwide Rollout</title>
    <meta name="description" content="India aims to implement a nationwide digital crop survey (DCS) by the 2025-26 Kharif season, replacing the manual Patwari-Girdawari system. DCS utilizes technologies like remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and AI to generate real-time crop production data. 

The survey aims to standardize agricultural data by creating a unified crop registry and address discrepancies in crop output projections.  

DCS is currently underway in 15 states, covering 3 lakh villages and 485 districts.  The government aims to expand the survey to at least one district in each state.  Data gathered from the survey will assist government agencies in implementing effective agricultural policies.">
