    <meta name="description" content="Dr. Nikku Madhusudhan, an Indian-origin astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge, and his team detected dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b, 120 light-years from Earth. DMS is primarily produced by living organisms on Earth, making its detection a potential biosignature. 

K2-18b, a sub-Neptune-sized planet, was identified in 2017 and is believed to have a warm ocean.  The presence of DMS, alongside methane and carbon dioxide, strengthens the hypothesis that K2-18b could support life. 

While this discovery doesn't confirm life, it provides compelling evidence and adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting the possibility of extraterrestrial life. 


Further analysis of K2-18b using the James Webb Space Telescope and future missions is planned.">
