    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Lover's Rage: Man Sets Woman Ablaze in Mathura</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, a 28-year-old man, disguised as a woman, set his 30-year-old married lover on fire inside her home after she refused to elope with him.  The victim, Rekha, suffered over 70% burns, while the accused, Umesh, sustained injuries attempting to escape.  Police investigations revealed Umesh and Rekha had a relationship that began after she left home with him last August.  Rekha was brought back by her family in February after a police complaint and had since distanced herself from Umesh. The incident occurred when Umesh pressured Rekha to leave with him, and upon her refusal, he set her ablaze. Both are in critical condition and receiving treatment. No formal complaint has been filed yet, but legal action will be taken.">
