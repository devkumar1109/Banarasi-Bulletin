    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT (BHU) Wins Hackathon with Age-Revealing Glycan Tech</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A research team from IIT (BHU), Varanasi, has won the Forensic Hackathon 2025 for developing a glycan-based forensic technology. This innovative method accurately estimates age using biological fluids, potentially revolutionizing forensic investigations in India. 

The technology uses glycomic profiling and machine learning to decode molecular signatures, providing insights into an individual's health and physiological condition. This approach overcomes limitations of DNA-based methods, which can be less accurate with degraded samples or diverse populations.  

The IIT (BHU) team's technology estimates both chronological and biological age, offering valuable context about an individual's health status and potentially providing critical leads in criminal investigations.">
