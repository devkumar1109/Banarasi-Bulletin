    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Inter Kashi Appeals Win: Title Hopes Rekindled</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Inter Kashi won their first appeal at the CAS against the AIFF regarding a three-point deduction. The deduction stemmed from a disputed match against Namdhari FC where Namdhari was accused of fielding an ineligible player. This win doesn't automatically crown Inter Kashi I-League champions. 

They initially finished second with 39 points, while Churchill Brothers won with 40 points.  The CAS ruling requires the AIFF to pay Inter Kashi compensation. Inter Kashi has a second appeal pending at the CAS, which could determine the 2024-25 I-League champions.">
