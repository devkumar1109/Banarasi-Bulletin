    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh ATS conducted searches in Lucknow, Azamgarh, Mau and Ballia following the arrest of 19-year-old Abdul Rehman from Faridabad for allegedly planning an attack on the Ram temple in Ayodhya.  Two hand grenades were found in Rehman's possession. Investigations revealed he was in contact with radical elements linked to international terror outfits. The ATS visited homes of individuals with questionable credentials, particularly those with suspicious email activity.  Rehman, an e-rickshaw driver, was supporting his family and had a history of health issues.  Locals observed a change in his behavior in recent months, becoming withdrawn and associating with a smaller group of young men. His frequent trips to Faizabad, Delhi, and Visakhapatnam raised concerns.">
