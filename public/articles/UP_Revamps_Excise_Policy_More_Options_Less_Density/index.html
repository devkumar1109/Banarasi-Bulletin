    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Revamps Excise Policy: More Options, Less Density</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh's new excise policy for 2025-26 is in effect. It replaces separate foreign liquor and beer shops with composite shops, increasing retail density without adding more shops. Composite shops with at least 400 square feet can become model shops and serve liquor. Country liquor shops can sell beer under certain conditions. 

Low-alcoholic bars serving beer and wine have been introduced in Noida, Ghaziabad, Agra, and Lucknow. Bars and premium retail vends can open in IT and ITeS establishments over 20,000 square meters. Liquor tasting is allowed at wineries, breweries, and distilleries. The 90 ml category has been added to the regular IMFL category. Event bar licenses are now categorized to prevent misuse. Steps have been taken to promote responsible tourism in alcohol production facilities.">
