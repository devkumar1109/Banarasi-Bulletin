    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Silent Prayer, Violent Response at IIMT</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Six Muslim students were arrested for peacefully protesting at IIMT University in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh. The protest was sparked by the imprisonment of Khalid Pradhan, a fellow Muslim student, for offering namaz on campus. 

Approximately 400 students participated in the silent demonstration, demanding Pradhan's release. Despite the peaceful nature of the protest, police intervened, using lathis to disperse the crowd.

One student criticized the university's treatment of Muslims during Ramadan, highlighting the fact that Hindu pujas are also celebrated on campus. Authorities, however, deemed the protest illegal.">
