    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Wheat Procurement Boom: Farmers Reap Rewards</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Wheat procurement in Varanasi division has significantly increased this year, reaching 9,711.59 metric tons across Varanasi, Chandauli, Ghazipur, and Jaunpur districts. This represents a rise of 3,746.88 metric tons compared to 2024.

Payments are made within 48 hours to farmers' Aadhaar-linked accounts. With 332 procurement centers and a target of 127,500 metric tons for the division, the government aims to benefit farmers through these initiatives.">
