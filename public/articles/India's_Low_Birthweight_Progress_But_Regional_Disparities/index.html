    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - India's Low Birthweight: Progress, But Regional Disparities</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A study analyzing data from India's National Family Health Survey found that the prevalence of low birth weight decreased from 26% in 1993 to 18% in 2021. Despite this progress, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, and West Bengal account for nearly half of India's low birth weight cases. 

The study, published in the BMJ Global Health, highlights the persistent issue of low birth weight in certain regions. While the national average has declined, these four states continue to bear a disproportionate burden. The study also found a correlation between low birth weight and maternal education levels, with babies born to mothers with less education facing a higher risk.">
