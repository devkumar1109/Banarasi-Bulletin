    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Holi of Ashes: Varanasi's Unique Tradition</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Varanasi, Naga Sadhus and Aghoris will celebrate 'Chita Bhasm ki Holi' at Harishchandra and Manikarnika ghats on Monday and Tuesday. This unique tradition, also known as 'Masane ki Holi', involves playing with funeral pyre ashes.  

The event, organized by the Manikarnika Mahashamshan and Baba Mahashamshan Nath Temple, will include special prayers and Chita Bhasm Aarti. Despite objections from some groups claiming it violates tradition, Aghorpeeth Harishchandra Ghat Kashi's head, Avadhoot Ugra Chandeshwar Kapali, defended the practice, stating it holds a special religious significance in Kashi and is a celebration of Lord Shiva. Kapali Baba emphasized that Kashi, considered Lord Shiva's abode, has unique traditions and the celebration should be viewed within its local beliefs.">
