    <meta name="description" content="Raghvendra Bajpai, a 36-year-old journalist and RTI activist, was murdered in Sitapur on Saturday.  Eight individuals, including four lekhpals, have been taken into custody for questioning. Protests erupted in six districts, with journalists demanding justice.  BJP national vice-president Rekha Verma, UP Congress chief Ajay Rai, and Apna Dal (Kamerawdi) MLA Pallavi Patel visited Bajpai's residence, offering condolences and urging stern action.  Rai criticized the incident as indicative of "jungle raj" in the state.  Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Brajesh Pathak assured the strictest action against the culprits.
