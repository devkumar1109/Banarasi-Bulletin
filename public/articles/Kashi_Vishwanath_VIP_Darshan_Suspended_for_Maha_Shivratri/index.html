    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Kashi Vishwanath: VIP Darshan Suspended for Maha Shivratri</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In preparation for Mahashivratri 2025, VIP darshan at Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi has been suspended for three days (February 25-27). This decision was made due to the expected large influx of devotees, including revered sadhus, saints, and Naga sadhus. 

The temple trust implemented this measure to ensure a smooth and safe experience for all visitors. Devotees, including VIP pass holders, will view Lord Shiva from a distance.  

Over one crore devotees have already visited the Kashi Vishwanath temple during the first 17 days of February, surpassing previous records. This surge in visitors is attributed to the ongoing Mahakumbh in Prayagraj. 


Authorities have closed schools up to Class 8 in Varanasi to manage the heavy congestion caused by the influx.">
