    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - "Chor Bazari Phir Se": Remix Falls Flat</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The remix song "Chor Bazari Phir Se" from Rajkummar Rao and Wamiqa Gabbi's upcoming film "Bhool Chuk Maaf" has been released.  The track, a reimagining of the popular "Love Aaj Kal" song, features familiar lyrics but fails to capture the original's magic.  

Despite being composed by Pritam, Tanishk Bagchi, and Irshad Kamil, the remix lacks a memorable hook or emotional connection. The production is polished but relies heavily on the original song's charm.  

"Bhool Chuk Maaf," directed by Karan Sharma and produced by Dinesh Vijan and Maddock Films, is a quirky romantic comedy set in Varanasi with a time-loop twist. The film releases in theaters worldwide on May 9, 2025.">
