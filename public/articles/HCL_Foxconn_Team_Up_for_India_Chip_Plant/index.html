    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - HCL, Foxconn Team Up for India Chip Plant</title>
    <meta name="description" content="HCL and Foxconn are partnering to build a $450 million semiconductor assembly and test unit in Jewar, Uttar Pradesh. 

The unit, expected to start production in 2027, will produce display driver chips, meeting 40% of India's domestic demand. It will have a monthly capacity of 36 million chips and 20,000 wafers.

The Indian government will provide Rs 1,800 crore in subsidies, while the Uttar Pradesh government will contribute Rs 600 crore.

This project is the sixth semiconductor unit under the India Semiconductor Mission and the first in Uttar Pradesh. It aims to strengthen India's domestic smartphone manufacturing ecosystem and support localization efforts.">
