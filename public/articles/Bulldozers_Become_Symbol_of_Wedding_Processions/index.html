    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - "Bulldozing into Matrimony: India's Newest Wedding Trend Takes a Political Turn"</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Uttar Pradesh, couples are incorporating bulldozers into their wedding processions to show support for Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's demolition drive. A couple, Rahul Yadav and Karishma, used a decorated bulldozer in their procession, which included 11 more bulldozers. This trend is seen as a nod to Adityanath's use of bulldozers to demolish properties linked to alleged criminals, particularly in Muslim-majority areas. The use of bulldozers has drawn criticism, with the Supreme Court halting such demolitions last year. Despite this, many continue to embrace it as a symbol of power and influence, earning Adityanath the nickname "Bulldozer Baba". The trend has sparked debate about the symbolism and implications of using bulldozers in wedding processions, with some seeing it as a show of support for the BJP and others as a divisive symbol.">
