Each old age home accommodates up to 150 residents and operates under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model. The government also provides old-age pensions, religious pilgrimage trips, and a face-recognition attendance system for transparency. 

To address grievances, 216 reconciliation officers have been appointed at the tehsil level, and District Magistrate-led committees oversee old age home management.">
