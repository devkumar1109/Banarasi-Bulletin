    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Ganga Expressway: Yogi Checks Progress, Targets Timely Completion</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath inspected the construction progress of the Ganga Expressway, directing officials to ensure its timely completion while maintaining high quality standards. 

The 594 km expressway, being developed by UPEIDA, connects Meerut and Prayagraj, bridging the two extremities of the state. The CM assessed construction quality in Hardoi, Shahjahanpur, and Hapur districts, including a 3.5 km airstrip in Shahjahanpur where a night landing demonstration is planned for May 2nd & 3rd. 

The expressway, estimated at Rs 36,230 crore, will connect 12 cities and span across 518 villages, playing a vital role in the Pradhan Mantri Gati Shakti Yojana.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the project in December 2021.">
