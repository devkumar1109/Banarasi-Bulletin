    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Cauvery Aarti Allowed, But With Conditions</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Karnataka High Court refused to halt the 'Cauvery Aarti' event at Sankey Tank, scheduled for Friday.  The court, however, mandated that the state government and civic authorities strictly follow legal provisions governing activities in water bodies, particularly Section 12 of the Karnataka Tank Conservation and Development Authority (KTCDA) Act, 2014. 

The court emphasized the importance of public order and crowd management during the event. The event, modeled after Varanasi's Ganga aarti, aims to promote water conservation.  

The Karnataka government plans to organize the event alongside a water conservation campaign.  Although presented as a government program, the 'Cauvery Aarti' has sparked concerns about its impact on the Sankey Tank ecosystem and potential political undertones.">
