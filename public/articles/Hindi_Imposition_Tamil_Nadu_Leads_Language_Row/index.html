    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Hindi Imposition: Tamil Nadu Leads Language Row</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The debate over Hindi imposition in India has intensified, with Tamil Nadu leading the opposition to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020's three-language formula. Tamil Nadu views the formula as an attempt to impose Hindi, while the Centre argues it aims to promote all Indian languages. 

This conflict echoes historical resistance to Hindi dominance, with Tamil Nadu staging major protests against Hindi imposition in 1937 and 1965. The NEP's formula, critics argue, disproportionately favors Hindi while neglecting the promotion of non-Hindi languages in Hindi-speaking states. 

The issue extends beyond education, carrying significant political implications. The "Hindi belt," a region crucial to the BJP's electoral success, benefits from Hindi's promotion as a national language, potentially solidifying their voter base.">
