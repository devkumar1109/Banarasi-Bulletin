    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Yadav Slams BJP: Hitler Comparisons, Corruption Allegations</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav criticized the BJP, comparing their events to Hitler's regime and calling Karni Sena "BJP's troopers."  He accused the BJP of spending heavily to defame the SP and Congress while endangering the Constitution.  Yadav also refuted the BJP's claims of a zero-tolerance policy against crime, citing the deaths of a Dalit youth in police custody in Azamgarh and a Brahmin in Basti. He accused the Yogi Adityanath government of focusing on protecting the accused rather than aiding victims. Yadav further criticized the government's handling of investment incentives and alleged corruption within the party, stating that BJP leaders are more concerned with commissions than development.  He advised party members to avoid controversial statements, particularly on historical issues.">
