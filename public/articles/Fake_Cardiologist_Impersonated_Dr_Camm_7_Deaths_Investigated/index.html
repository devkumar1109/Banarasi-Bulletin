    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Fake Cardiologist Impersonated Dr. Camm, 7 Deaths Investigated</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A man named Narendra Vikramaditya Yadav, who allegedly impersonated UK-based cardiologist Dr. John Camm, has been arrested in Madhya Pradesh, India.  Yadav is accused of forging medical qualifications and working at Mission Hospital in Damoh, where at least seven patient deaths are being investigated. Police suspect Yadav stole Dr. Camm's identity, which was first used on a Twitter account approximately five years ago. The account posted on political issues, including one urging India to send Uttar Pradesh's Chief Minister to control riots in France, which was retweeted by the CM's official account. Dr. Camm's identity was questioned by several Indian cardiologists at the time.  Police are currently verifying Yadav's claims of performing medical procedures.">
