    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Streamlines Building Bylaws: Faster, Simpler Construction</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh is set to implement new building construction bylaws, the "Uttar Pradesh Building Construction and Development Byelaws 2025," after 16 years.  

Key changes include deregulation for smaller constructions, with no permission needed for residential plots up to 100 square meters and commercial buildings up to 30 square meters.  Reconstruction and renovation of residential buildings also fall under this exemption.  

A "Trust Based Online Approval" system will be introduced for building plans in sanctioned layouts prepared by licensed professionals, requiring self-declaration and affidavit. 

The bylaws aim to simplify the construction process and remove unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles.">
