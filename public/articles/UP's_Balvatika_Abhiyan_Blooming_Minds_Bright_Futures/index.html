    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh government launched the "Balvatika Abhiyan," a two-week campaign from April 16 to 29, focusing on early childhood education. The initiative aims to transform existing Anganwadi centers into Balvatikas, providing structured learning opportunities for children aged 3-6.  

The campaign emphasizes community involvement through activities like "Prabhat Pheri" parades, village assemblies, interactive sessions, storytelling, creative contests, and parent-teacher meetings.  These efforts aim to highlight the importance of early education and ensure enrollment of children in Balvatika classes.
