This practice is a testament to cultural integration.  ‘Kimami’ sewai, both raw and white varieties, is popular during Eid, while thicker, ghee-cooked ‘soot-pheni’ is favored for 'sehri' during Ramadan.  

Around 200 families in Varanasi, involving 2,000 people, produce sewai year-round, with production increasing two to three months before Ramadan.
