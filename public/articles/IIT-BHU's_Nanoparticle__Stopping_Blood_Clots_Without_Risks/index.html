    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT-BHU's Nanoparticle:  Stopping Blood Clots Without Risks</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Researchers at IIT-BHU have developed a novel material, Potassium Ferric Oxalate Nanoparticle (KFeOx-NPs), to prevent blood coagulation and thrombosis.  Unlike conventional anticoagulants like warfarin and heparin, which can cause side effects such as bleeding and bone density reduction, KFeOx-NPs work without altering blood structure or properties. 

In tests, KFeOx-NPs successfully prevented clotting in human blood samples for up to 48 hours and showed efficacy in a mouse model, preventing clot formation. This breakthrough offers a promising alternative for treating and preventing blood clot-related disorders like strokes, heart attacks, and pulmonary embolism, which are major causes of mortality worldwide.">
