    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Ambedkar Poster Sparks UP Political Firestorm</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A controversy erupted in Uttar Pradesh over a poster outside the Samajwadi Party (SP) office featuring half-faces of Akhilesh Yadav and B.R. Ambedkar.  The poster drew criticism from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and protests from BJP cadres who demanded an apology from Yadav. The SP distanced itself from the poster, suggesting it might be the work of BJP supporters.  

The incident comes amid the SP's efforts to woo Dalit and OBC voters, traditionally loyal to the BSP and BJP respectively. The SP's performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where they secured a significant number of seats, fueled this strategy. BSP chief Mayawati warned the SP and Congress against "insulting" Ambedkar, threatening street protests.">
