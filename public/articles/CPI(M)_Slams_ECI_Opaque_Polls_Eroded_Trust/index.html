    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - CPI(M) Slams ECI: Opaque Polls, Eroded Trust</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The CPI(M) expressed concern over the Election Commission of India (ECI) conducting polls in an "opaque and unconstitutional manner" for the past decade. They claim the ECI has eroded its autonomy, shown contempt for the opposition, and manipulated election laws and rules, making the process a "farce." 

A 2024 CSDS survey revealed only 28% of Indians trust the ECI. The party alleges violations of the Model Code of Conduct and the Representation of the People Act in recent elections, particularly the 2014 Lok Sabha, 2017 UP and Gujarat polls, and 2019 general election. 

The CPI(M) claims the ECI is denying political parties and citizens access to updated voter lists and voter ID cards, and points to disproportionate voter deletions in areas with a higher concentration of voters unlikely to support the BJP.  They call for a comprehensive review of voter inclusion to identify bogus electors.">
