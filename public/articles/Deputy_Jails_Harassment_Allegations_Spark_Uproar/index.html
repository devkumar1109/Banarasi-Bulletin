    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Deputy Jails Harassment Allegations Spark Uproar</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A woman deputy jailer in Varanasi, Meena Kanojia, has accused the district jail superintendent, Umesh Singh, of harassment. Kanojia alleges that the harassment intensified after she refused to visit Singh's home and that he publicly taunted her. She claims to have lodged a complaint with the DG (prison) four months ago detailing the harassment and corruption within the jail, but received no response. 

Following the release of a video detailing her allegations, Kanojia was transferred to Naini jail in Prayagraj. The UP Congress Committee president criticized the transfer, claiming it demonstrates a failure to address women's empowerment claims.  Investigations are underway against both Kanojia and Singh.">
