    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - 26 Years On The Run: Kidnapper Caught</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Vinod Kumar Gupta (49) was arrested in Uttar Pradesh after 26 years on the run for the 1999 kidnapping, murder, and ransom of Bhiwandi powerloom owner Jigar Mahendra Mehta. Gupta, along with Raju Mehta (absconding) and Kamlesh Uppadhyay (already arrested), planned the crime.  

They disconnected the factory's power, lured Mehta to restore it, and killed him after robbing him. They demanded a ransom of Rs10 lakh from Mehta's family. Gupta, a student at Jija Bai College at the time, was lured into the crime with promises of money. He lived under an assumed identity in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, even opening a medical store.">
