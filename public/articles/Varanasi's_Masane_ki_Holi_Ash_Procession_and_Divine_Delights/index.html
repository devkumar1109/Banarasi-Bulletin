    <meta name="description" content="In Varanasi, Naga Sadhus and aghoris celebrated Masane ki Holi at Harishchandra Ghat on Rangbhari Ekadashi. A grand procession, led by Kashi Mokshadayini Seva Samiti, featured Baba Masan Nath and artistes dressed as deities and ghosts. The procession culminated at Harishchandra Ghat, where Naga Sadhus, who had participated in the Prayagraj Maha Kumbh, played Holi with pyre ash.  Organizers procured five quintals of pyre ash for the occasion and opted for traditional Banarasi Nagara groups instead of DJs. A similar event will take place at Manikarnika Ghat on Tuesday.">
