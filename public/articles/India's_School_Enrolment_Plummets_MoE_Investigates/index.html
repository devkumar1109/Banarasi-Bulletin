    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - India's School Enrolment Plummets: MoE Investigates</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Enrolment in government schools across 23 Indian states and union territories has dropped significantly in 2024-25, prompting the Union Ministry of Education (MoE) to investigate the reasons and seek remedial plans from the states.  

Eight states witnessed declines exceeding 100,000 students, led by Uttar Pradesh with a drop of 21.83 lakh. Other states with notable declines include Bihar, Rajasthan, and West Bengal.

The MoE expressed concern over the trend, which follows a sharper overall decline in school enrollment documented in the UDISE+ report for 2023-24. Officials suspect the drop could be due to the removal of "ghost entries" and families returning to private schools after the COVID-19 pandemic.">
