    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Rupert: Tech, Not "White Genocide", Solves SA's Crime</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Billionaire Johann Rupert refuted Donald Trump's claims of "white genocide" in South Africa, attributing the violence to poverty, gang activity, and illegal immigration. He emphasized that all communities are affected, not just white farmers. Rupert urged technological and political solutions, suggesting Elon Musk and Trump focus on constructive measures. He highlighted the potential of technology like Starlink and drones to combat crime and cited drone use against poaching, halted due to U.S. spying concerns. Rupert recalled New York's crime reduction through strong leadership and hopes for similar progress in South Africa.  He stressed the link between illegal immigration, unemployment, and violence, noting the economic hardship caused by big companies leaving towns. Rupert advocated for economic growth to address these issues.  He condemned apartheid and acknowledged being targeted for his views, citing high crime rates in areas like Cape Flats due to gang warfare.  Rupert called for help to stop the killings, emphasizing that crime affects everyone.">
