    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Shringar Gauri: Devotees Worship Freely at Gyanvapi</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Thousands of devotees joined plaintiffs in praying to Shringar Gauri at Gyanvapi in Varanasi on Wednesday, the fourth day of Chaitra Navratri.  This marks the first time since the Babri Masjid demolition that devotees were not restricted in accessing Shringar Gauri. The Kashi Vishwanath Dham administration facilitated the worship, providing coconuts, fruit offerings, and assisting with the ceremonial event. 

The Gyanvapi Mukti Mahaparishad, an RSS-supported outfit, termed the event a show of strength for the pro-Hindu government and claimed the Gyanvapi complex will soon be restored to its original state. They allege previous governments obstructed worship due to appeasement politics. The Mahaparishad performed a Rudrabhishek at the Satyanarayan Temple before entering the KV Dham, with 15 tribal girls from Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram also participating in the worship.">
