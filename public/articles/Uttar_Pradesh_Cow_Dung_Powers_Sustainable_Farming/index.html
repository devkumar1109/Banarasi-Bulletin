    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Uttar Pradesh: Cow Dung Powers Sustainable Farming</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh government aims to make cow shelters self-reliant by using cow dung and urine for natural farming. This initiative will involve producing vermicompost in shelters, which will be sold to farmers, promoting eco-friendly agriculture and enhancing soil fertility. 

The government is collaborating with organizations like NABARD and the National Dairy Development Board to implement these projects.  Farmers and shelter staff will also be trained in fodder production and preservation to improve cattle nutrition. 

This initiative aligns with the state government's focus on natural farming and the health of people, land, and water,  providing benefits to both farmers and the environment.">
