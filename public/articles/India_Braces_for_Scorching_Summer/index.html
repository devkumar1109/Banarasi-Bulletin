    <meta name="description" content="India is anticipating a severe summer season with above-normal temperatures lasting up to 11 days, especially in central and eastern states. 

The World Meteorological Organisation has declared 2024 as the warmest year in 175 years, with global temperatures exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 

Extreme heat can lead to significant economic losses, impacting labor productivity, agriculture, healthcare, infrastructure, and supply chains. 

India experienced its most intense heatwave year in 2024, with June in the northwestern region recording a record 181 heatwave days. 

The urban heat island effect exacerbates heat in cities, projected to warm by 4 degrees Celsius on average by 2100. 

Heatwaves pose serious health risks, including excess mortality, and can lead to social disruptions like school closures, livelihood loss, water shortages, power outages, and food insecurity. 



Heat Action Plans (HAPs) are now the primary tool for managing heat-related health risks in Indian cities.">
