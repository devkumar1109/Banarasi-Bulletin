    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP's Healthcare Leap: Global Standards, Local Access</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh government is launching a new health policy to develop world-class healthcare infrastructure across the state.  The policy, a five-year blueprint, aims to attract private investment through public-private partnerships.  It prioritizes expanding advanced medical facilities in both urban and rural areas, ensuring quality healthcare accessibility at the local level.  

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has directed officials to ensure UP's health infrastructure meets global standards. The new policy will establish super-specialty services like neurosurgery, cardiology, and oncology in every district. Private hospitals will be integrated with government health schemes like Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana. 

The policy will be implemented in three models: Model A (17 Municipal Corporations), Model B (57 district headquarters), and Model C (rural and backward areas).  Each model will see the establishment of hospitals with varying bed capacities, offering advanced medical services.">
