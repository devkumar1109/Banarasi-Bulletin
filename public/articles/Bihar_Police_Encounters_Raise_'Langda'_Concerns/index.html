    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Bihar Police Encounters Raise 'Langda' Concerns</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Bihar Police conducted five encounters between June 12 and June 14 in Patna, Muzaffarpur, and Vaishali, resulting in several arrests and injuries to alleged criminals.  The encounters followed a similar pattern, with accused attempting to escape custody, firing at police, and being shot in the leg. 

While police deny emulating Uttar Pradesh's 'Operation Langda' model, the incidents resemble it. Patna saw three encounters: Ishu Kumar (murder accused), Angesh Kumar (wanted in multiple cases), and Vivek Kumar (shooting murder accused) were all injured in the leg during alleged escape attempts. In Vaishali, Rajiv Mali, a known criminal, was injured during an exchange of fire, while his accomplice Pramod was arrested.  ADG Kundan Krishnan stated that police respond to criminal aggression and that encounters are a last resort.">
