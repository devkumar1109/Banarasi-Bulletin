    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - SP X Account FIR: "Objectionable" Post Sparks Row</title>
    <meta name="description" content="An FIR was filed in Lucknow against the unknown handler of the Samajwadi Party's (SP) official X account for a post deemed "objectionable" and targeting Uttar Pradesh Deputy CM Brajesh Pathak. 

BJP leader Anand Dwivedi filed the complaint, alleging the post contained derogatory remarks about Pathak's deceased mother and aimed to incite social unrest.  The post was deleted but Pathak and Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya condemned the language used, calling it "cheap" and "anti-social." 

The SP media cell responded by referencing past instances where Pathak used the phrase "DNA of Samajwadi Party," further escalating the political controversy. BJP workers staged protests in Hazratganj over the incident.">
