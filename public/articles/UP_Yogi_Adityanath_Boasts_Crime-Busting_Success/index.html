    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath claims the state's law and order has become a national model, citing a decline in crime rates based on National Crime Records Bureau data. He highlights a significant increase in convictions for crimes against women, with 51 death sentences and 6,287 life sentences handed down under the state's "operation conviction" initiative since July 2023.  Adityanath attributes the improvement to strengthened security forces, including the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), and police reforms such as the implementation of the police commissionerate system and the establishment of new ATS field units and women PAC battalions.  He also notes the recruitment of over 1.56 lakh personnel since 2017 with ongoing recruitment drives.">
