    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Varanasi Walks: Clubfoot Program Heals Children</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Over 70 children in Varanasi have recovered from clubfoot since 2019 thanks to a program run by the health department's Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) and Anushka Foundation.  

512 children have been treated under this program, with 64 children already recovered. Free treatment is available at various hospitals in Varanasi, including Pt Deendayal Upadhyay Hospital, SSPG Divisional Hospital, Kabirchaura, and BHU Trauma Center.

Clubfoot is treated using the Ponseti method, involving casting, tenotomy (cutting the Achilles tendon), and bracing. Early treatment, especially within the first few months of birth, is essential for better outcomes. Parents are encouraged to contact RBSK through local health centers if their child has clubfoot. Registration for treatment and monitoring can be done at sabalkashi.com.">
