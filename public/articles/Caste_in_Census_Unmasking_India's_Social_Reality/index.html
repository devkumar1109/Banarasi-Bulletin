    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Caste in Census: Unmasking India's Social Reality</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Indian government plans to include caste in the next census, the first comprehensive enumeration since 1931. Labour sociologist Sumeet Mhaskar argues this is essential for understanding India's social reality, not just political opportunism.  

Mhaskar emphasizes that documenting caste, like gender or poverty, is crucial for addressing structural inequalities.  He points to the differing outcomes of caste-based politics in Tamil Nadu and Bihar, and highlights the historical suppression of reservation policies by bureaucracies.  

Mhaskar suggests that the real challenge lies in the shrinking public sector and lack of quality employment, rather than just reservation.">
