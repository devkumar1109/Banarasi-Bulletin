    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Sustainable Seeds: Farmers Embrace Modern Techniques</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A two-day training program on direct seeded rice (DSR) and zero tillage wheat (ZTW) was held in Varanasi for 70 farmers from Eastern Uttar Pradesh. The program, organized by the International Rice Research Institute-South Asia Regional Centre (ISARC), aimed to introduce sustainable farming techniques to improve rice-wheat cultivation. 

Experts from ISARC, IRRI, World Bank, Bayer Crop Science, and Savannah emphasized the need for agricultural transformation in the region. 

Farmers learned about the benefits of DSR and ZTW, including reduced labor costs, water savings, and increased productivity. They also received training on nutrient and weed management, as well as hands-on experience with mechanization equipment at ISARC's Mechanisation Hub.  The program concluded with discussions on scaling these practices and improving market linkages for farmers.">
