    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT-BHU's Nanoparticle: Stopping Clots, Saving Lives</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A team at IIT-BHU developed Potassium Ferric Oxalate Nanoparticle (KFeOx-NPs) to prevent blood clotting and thrombosis. 

This novel material effectively stops clot formation for up to 48 hours without altering blood cell structure. 

It offers a safer alternative to current anticoagulants like warfarin and heparin, which can cause side effects like bleeding and bone density loss. 

KFeOx-NPs also addresses limitations of chemical anticoagulants used in blood collection tubes by preventing structural changes in blood cells.

The research, published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, demonstrated the material's efficacy in both human blood samples and a mouse model.  A patent has been filed to protect the intellectual property and facilitate clinical translation.">
