    <meta name="description" content="India is strategically investing in AI development, aiming to build a complete AI stack from semiconductor fabrication to energy management. This includes establishing domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, developing low-cost large language models (LLMs) tailored to Indian context, and significantly increasing nuclear energy capacity. 

The Union Budget 2025-2026 allocated Rs 20,000 crore for research and development of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) to achieve 100 GW nuclear energy capacity by 2047.  Nuclear energy is seen as a reliable and cost-effective source to power AI's high energy demands.  India's External Affairs Minister, S Jaishankar, emphasized the nation's historical role as a technology provider and highlighted Prime Minister Modi's participation in the AI Action Summit in Paris.">
