A government study has revealed the state of panchayats in India, with Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu topping the Panchayat Devolution Index (PDI) for 2024. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have recorded the biggest improvements. The study, conducted by the Indian Institute of Public Administration, evaluated 172 panchayats in 68 districts across India on six parameters: framework, functions, finances, functionaries, capacity building, and accountability. The national average score rose from 39.92 to 43.89 over the past decade. Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, and Jharkhand are the lowest-scoring states, while Manipur, Arunachal, and Haryana have seen the biggest declines in the past decade. The study highlights the challenges confronting panchayats in India and provides a comprehensive analysis of how each state has performed in terms of devolution of powers and responsibilities to these bodies.">
