    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - IIT-BHU's Drone Network:  Limitless, Offline Communication</title>
    <meta name="description" content="IIT-BHU in Varanasi has developed a drone-based communication system that operates without internet connectivity and offers virtually unlimited range. 

The system, led by Prof. Hari Prabhat Gupta, utilizes autonomous drones to create a dynamic mesh network for transmitting data across large distances, even in areas without infrastructure. 

This technology enables real-time image and text sharing in remote, obstructed, or high-interference regions, making it suitable for defense, border surveillance, disaster response, and more.  

The system is scalable, low-cost, and intelligent, with potential applications in national security, emergency rescue operations, and off-grid scenarios. 

IIT-BHU is continuing to develop the system, including integrating AI for autonomous path optimization and encryption for secure transmissions.">
