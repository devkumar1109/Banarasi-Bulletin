    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - AI-Generated Dance Video Lands User in Trouble</title>
    <meta name="description" content="An Instagram user, identified as "Priyanshu Rocks," has been booked by the Meerut police for uploading an AI-generated video of a police inspector dancing with Muskan Rastogi, a woman accused of murdering her husband. The video, which went viral on social media platforms, purportedly shows Rastogi dancing with the police inspector. SP Ayush Vikram Singh stated that the video was created using AI and the police traced the Instagram ID responsible for uploading it.  

The user has been charged under the Information Technology Act Section 66 (computer-related offences). Police are investigating the matter and will take action against those who created and shared the video. The accused couple, Muskan Rastogi and Sahil Shukla, are currently in jail for the murder of Saurabh Rajput.  They were arrested on March 19 after the police recovered body parts from a cement drum.">
