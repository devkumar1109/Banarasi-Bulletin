    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Uttar Pradesh: Silks Up for 50,000 Women</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh government aims to significantly increase silk production by 2025-26.  The plan involves linking 7,500 rural groups to the State Rural Livelihood Mission. 

Fifteen districts will receive support through training, technology, and financial aid to empower silk producers.  The initiative targets 50,000 members of 5,000 women's groups for involvement in silk production over the next five years.  This aligns with the ODOP scheme and aims to achieve self-reliance in the silk industry by boosting exports.  Currently, Uttar Pradesh produces 400 metric tonnes of silk against a consumption of 3,500 metric tonnes.">
