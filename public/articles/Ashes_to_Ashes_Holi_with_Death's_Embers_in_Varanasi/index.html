    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Ashes to Ashes: Holi with Death's Embers in Varanasi</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Varanasi, Naga Sadhus and Aghoris will celebrate 'Chita Bhasm ki Holi' on March 11 and 12 at Manikarnika and Harishchandra ghats respectively. This unique tradition involves playing Holi with ashes from funeral pyres. Organisers, like Gulshan Kapoor and Avadhoot Ugra Chandeshwar Kapali (Kapali Baba), defended the practice, stating it is a deeply rooted religious custom in Kashi, where death is celebrated. They argued that Kashi, being Lord Shiva's abode, transcends ordinary rules and that this tradition holds a special place in the city's religious life. Some groups have objected, claiming it is not for householders to observe, but the organisers maintain it is a part of Kashi's unique traditions.">
