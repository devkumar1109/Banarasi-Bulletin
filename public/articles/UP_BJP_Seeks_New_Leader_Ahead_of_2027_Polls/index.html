    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP BJP Seeks New Leader Ahead of 2027 Polls</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The BJP is set to announce a new president for its Uttar Pradesh unit by early next week. The process, initiated in October 2024, was delayed due to internal considerations.  Union Home Minister Amit Shah's recent visit to Lucknow and a meeting with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath have reportedly finalized the decision.  

With the 2027 Assembly polls approaching, the BJP is considering an OBC or Dalit leader for the post. Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Maurya, a prominent OBC leader, is a strong contender.  Other names in the running include Union Ministers B.L. Verma and Pankaj Chowdhary, and State Animal Husbandry Minister Dharampal Singh.  This move comes after the BJP's performance declined in the 2024 parliamentary polls, with the Samajwadi Party and Congress gaining ground.">
