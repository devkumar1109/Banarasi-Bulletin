    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BJP's Digital District President Unveiling</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The BJP will announce new district presidents for Uttar Pradesh online for the first time on Sunday. The process will involve live streaming from party headquarters in Lucknow and coordinated WhatsApp groups.  

A task center will monitor the announcement, with district election officers receiving the names via WhatsApp and then announcing them in local meetings.

Out of 98 organizational districts, presidents for 87 are expected to be announced.  Approximately 50% of these positions will be filled by OBCs, SCs/STs, and women, aiming to counter the Samajwadi Party's (SP) "PDA" (Pichhda, Dalit, and Alpsankhyak) appeal.
