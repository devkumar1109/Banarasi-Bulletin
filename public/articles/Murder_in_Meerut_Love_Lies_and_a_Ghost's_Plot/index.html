    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Murder in Meerut: Love, Lies, and a "Ghost's" Plot</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Muskan Rastogi and her lover Sahil Shukla were arrested for the murder of Muskan's husband, Saurabh Rajput. The couple allegedly killed Saurabh on March 4th, dismembered his body, and sealed it in a drum. 

A video surfaced online showing Muskan and Sahil celebrating Holi just 11 days after the murder. They had fled to Himachal Pradesh after the crime but returned to Meerut on March 17th.

According to police, Muskan had been planning the murder since November 2023 and manipulated Sahil using his superstitions. Muskan allegedly created a fake Snapchat account impersonating Sahil's deceased mother to convince him that her "spirit" wanted Saurabh dead.  Authorities are investigating the occult angle and potential involvement of others. Both Muskan and Sahil are in 14-day judicial custody.">
