    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Wife, Lover, and a Fake Snakebite</title>
    <meta name="description" content="In Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, a 25-year-old laborer, Amit, was strangled to death by his wife, Ravita, and her lover, Amardeep. 

To conceal the crime, the couple placed a live snake near Amit's body, claiming he died from a snakebite.  Local villagers captured the snake, but suspicions arose, leading to a post-mortem examination. 

The autopsy revealed strangulation as the cause of death, resulting in the arrest of Ravita and Amardeep.  Both are currently in police custody facing murder charges.  This incident follows another murder in Meerut last month where a husband was killed by his wife and her lover, who dismembered the body and hid it.">
