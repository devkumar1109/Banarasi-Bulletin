    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Gutkha Ban After MLA Spat Sparks Debate</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh Assembly banned chewing gutkha inside its premises following an incident where an MLA spat paan masala on the carpet. Assembly Speaker Satish Mahana, who oversaw the cleaning and reprimanded the MLA, implemented the ban after debate and said he knew the culprit due to CCTV footage. Mahana, while not publicly naming the MLA, urged them to take responsibility privately.  

This incident follows a 2022 spat in the same Assembly where an Opposition leader tweeted a video of a BJP MLA chewing tobacco, highlighting the hypocrisy of promoting anti-gutkha campaigns.  

West Bengal also proposed a bill in February to combat spitting tobacco, paan, and paan masala in public places, citing aesthetic and beautification concerns.">
