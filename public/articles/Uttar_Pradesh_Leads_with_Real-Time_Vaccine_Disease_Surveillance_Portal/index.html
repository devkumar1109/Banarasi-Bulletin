    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Uttar Pradesh Leads with Real-Time Vaccine Disease Surveillance Portal</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Uttar Pradesh has become the first state to implement real-time digital surveillance of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) through its Unified Disease Surveillance Portal (UDSP). Launched on May 1, 2025, the system facilitates real-time case reporting and accurate data collection for six VPDs: poliomyelitis, measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus. This initiative, supported by the World Health Organization's National Public Health Support Network (NPSN), aims to enable rapid disease detection, effective outbreak response, and timely implementation of strategies. The UDSP, developed post-Covid, integrates surveillance data and allows citizens to access lab reports online. During World Immunization Week, UP is conducting a school-based TD vaccination campaign, ensuring free vaccination for students in grades 5 and 10 across both government and private schools.">
