    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Forged Letters Land 3 in Almora Health Job Scam</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Three men from Uttar Pradesh, Arun Shukla, Jaiveer Singh, and Birbal Singh, were recently booked for allegedly securing jobs in Uttarakhand's Almora health department using forged appointment letters in 1989. They served as multipurpose health workers and received salaries. Concerns were raised about their fraudulent appointments in 1992, but they obtained a court stay on departmental action.  

The matter resurfaced in 2021 when Birbal applied for pension and retirement benefits.  A review of Birbal's records revealed forged appointment letters. While a court stay was granted, Birbal failed to appear thereafter.  Almora CMO Dr R C Pant lodged a formal complaint against all three at Almora police station, leading to an FIR being registered under IPC sections related to forgery and cheating.">
