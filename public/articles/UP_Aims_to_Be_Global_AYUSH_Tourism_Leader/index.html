    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - UP Aims to Be Global AYUSH Tourism Leader</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh government is promoting the state as a health tourism hub, focusing on Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy (AYUSH). Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath believes UP can lead in health tourism after establishing itself in religious tourism.  

The global AYUSH market has experienced significant growth, increasing from $2.85 billion in 2014 to $43.4 billion in 2024. The state's first AYUSH University, named after Mahayogi Guru Gorakhnath, is nearing completion in Gorakhpur and will offer comprehensive healthcare services and academic programs.  

 UP's cultural and spiritual legacy, combined with the growing global recognition of Ayurveda, positions the state as a natural choice for becoming a global leader in AYUSH.">
