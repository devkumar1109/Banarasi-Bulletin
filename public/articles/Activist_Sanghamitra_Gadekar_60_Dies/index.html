    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Activist Sanghamitra Gadekar, 60, Dies</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Sanghamitra Gadekar, an anti-nuclear activist and daughter of Narayan Desai, passed away on April 28th after a long illness. She was known for her work with widowed Muslim women from the 2002 Gujarat carnage and her research on the harmful impacts of nuclear energy alongside her life partner, Surendra Gadekar.

In 2012, the Gadekar's challenged the IAEA's clean chit to the Rajasthan Atomic Power Plant (RAPP) after  tritium leaks and worker radiation exposure. They conducted an independent health survey revealing high cancer and leukemia rates in the vicinity, which they published in a medical journal but was ignored by NPCIL. Sanghamitra also served as a Medical Officer at Vasant Women’s University and Sanjeevani Hospital in Varanasi.">
