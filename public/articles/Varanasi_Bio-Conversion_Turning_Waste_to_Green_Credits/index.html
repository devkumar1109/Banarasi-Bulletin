    <meta name="description" content="EKI Energy Services Ltd will manage carbon credit realization for the Varanasi Smart City Bio-Conversion Project. The project, located in Shahanshahpur, processes 70 tonnes of animal manure and organic feedstock daily using anaerobic digestion, producing 2,500-2,800 kg/day of compressed biogas (CBG) and by-products. 

The project is expected to reduce 33,187 tonnes of CO₂e emissions over seven years and has already avoided 2,806 tonnes during its first monitoring period. 

Supported by the Adani Group, Gobardhan Varanasi Foundation SPV, and local authorities under India's SATAT programme, the project creates over 25 jobs and supports sustainable farming practices.">
