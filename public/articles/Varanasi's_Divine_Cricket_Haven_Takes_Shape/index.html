The stadium will feature nine pitches (four red soil, three black soil, and two mixed wickets), making it unique in India. It will also include dormitories for 100 trainees of a proposed academy, solar panels, a water recycling system, and EV recharging facilities. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the stadium in September 2023.">
