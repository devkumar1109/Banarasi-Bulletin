    <meta name="description" content="To manage the expected massive crowd of devotees during Mahashivratri 2025, VIP darshan at Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh has been suspended from February 25 to 27. 

The temple trust made this decision considering the large number of devotees expected, along with the darshan puja of revered sadhus and saints. 

Schools up to Class 8 in Varanasi have been closed since January 27 due to the influx of devotees, a result of the ongoing Mahakumbh in Prayagraj. Over one crore devotees have visited Kashi Vishwanath Temple from February 1-17. Authorities are working to manage heavy congestion at transportation hubs and key areas due to the large number of pilgrims.">
