    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - Bageshwar Baba: From Faith to Political Power</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Dhirendra Krishna Shastri, the chief priest of Bageshwar Dham, has gained significant political influence. PM Modi recently visited Bageshwar Dham and referred to Shastri as a "younger brother," laying the foundation stone for a medical research institute there.  Shastri, originally known for his devotional discourses and problem-solving abilities, has adopted a hardline Hindutva stance, calling for a Hindu nation and urging Hindus to unite against conversions. His influence is significant in Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Jharkhand, with both Congress and BJP leaders trying to court him.  Shastri's rise has been aided by the support of former Congress MLA Alok Chaturvedi and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath.">
