    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - BJP Blasts Opposition Over Kumbh, Immigration</title>
    <meta name="description" content="BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi accused the opposition of seeking political gain from the Maha Kumbh stampede tragedy. He criticized Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav for questioning the death toll and using terms like "Mrityu Kumbh." Trivedi praised the successful organization of the Maha Kumbh, attributing its success to PM Modi's policies and the rejuvenation of religious sites like Kashi Vishwanath Dham and Ram Mandir.  

He also criticized the opposition's stance on the deportation of Indian immigrants by the US, stating they oppose India's efforts to tackle illegal immigration and view them as a vote bank. Trivedi contrasted this with the Congress-led government's handling of security issues, citing instances of disrespect shown to dignitaries and celebrities.">
