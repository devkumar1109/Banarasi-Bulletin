    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - NGT Slams Kumbh Mela Over Ganga Pollution</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government, Prayagraj Mela Authority, and the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board regarding open defecation along the banks of the Ganga river at the Kumbh Mela.  

An application filed by Nipun Bhushan highlighted poor sanitation arrangements and a water quality test showing high faecal coliform levels (3,300 MPN/100 ml) exceeding the Environment Ministry's benchmark of 2,500 MPN/100 ml.

The NGT cited a Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report indicating the Ganga's water quality was unfit for bathing due to high faecal coliform levels, particularly affecting those bathing during the Mahakumbh Mela. 
The CPCB report, based on samples collected in January, revealed that total coliform levels consistently exceeded prescribed standards. 


The NGT has directed the authorities to respond before the next hearing scheduled for Monday.">
