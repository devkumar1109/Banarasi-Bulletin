    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - "Fraudulent Fixing: 15 Health Workers Caught in Fake Document Scam"</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The police in Ballia, Uttar Pradesh, registered an FIR against 15 people for securing fraudulent appointments with forged documents at various health centres. The accused, including two women, were staff nurses at primary and community health centres. The scam surfaced after a complaint by Dr Vijay Pati Dwivedi, the District Chief Medical Officer, who found that some employees had submitted forged documents to gain employment and had been drawing salaries. A seven-member team investigated the matter, prompting the CMO to halt work and salary disbursements to the accused employees. Separately, a village head, Rahul Paswan, was arrested for allegedly raping a 40-year-old woman and was sent to jail after completing legal proceedings, with a case registered under sections related to punishment for rape and criminal intimidation.">
