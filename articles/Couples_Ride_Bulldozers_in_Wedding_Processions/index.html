    <title>Banarasi Bulletin - "Bulldozing into Matrimony: Uttar Pradesh Couples Ride in Support of Yogi Adityanath"</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Couples in Jhansi and Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, are incorporating bulldozers into their wedding processions to show support for Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's demolition drive. Rahul Yadav and his bride Karishma rode a decorated bulldozer in their Bidai ceremony, part of a procession with 11 more bulldozers. This gesture nods to Adityanath's use of bulldozers to demolish properties linked to alleged criminals, particularly in Muslim-majority areas. Adityanath's actions have earned him the nickname "Bulldozer Baba" and criticism for bypassing legal processes. Critics associate bulldozers with coercive tactics against minorities, but many see them as a symbol of power and influence. Similar displays have been seen elsewhere, including a 2022 India Day Parade in the US. Krishan Verma used a bulldozer in his marriage procession in Gorakhpur to assert BJP's power after a disappointing election result.">
